# Protocol: issues and pull requests

Normative for the GitHub-backed issue and PR lifecycle and the automation in
`local/bin/`; read `local/protocols/meta.md` first. The repository is
`Dengnifer/MIPStarRE-QPBT`, and GitHub is the **single source of truth** for
issues, PRs, CI and review evidence, and merges; CI and reviews still *execute*
here and publish their results there. No active `issues/` or `prs/` tree, no
shadow record, no write-through cache, no offline mutation mode: a GitHub error
fails the operation, never a local success (EVOLUTION.md 2026-09-01).

## 1. Records, names, tools

Issues and PRs are GitHub's, identified by their numbers — no zero-padded ids,
no frontmatter. Parent/child structure is the native sub-issue relation
(`POST …/issues/{parent}/sub_issues`), one parent per issue exactly as the
retired `parent:` scalar allowed; discussion is comments; labels come from the
repository (`list-labels`, paginated), so `local/labels.yml` is retired and a
label absent from GitHub is reported, never invented.
`pr_open.py --issue N` inherits only its explicit descriptive-label allowlist
from issue N, unions it with explicit `--label` values, and adds those labels
without removing existing PR labels. Scheduling, approval and owner-state
labels are never inherited. Before push, creation/adoption requires at least
one descriptive label, supplied explicitly, inherited, or already on the PR;
otherwise the command explains how the operator can classify the change.
GitHub still validates label existence; the allowlist is an inheritance policy,
not a replacement registry. Backfills use the same additive API and inspect
the actual change when the source issue itself is unlabeled. Briefs (the design record
per issue) live in `local/briefs/`: agent input, not lifecycle state.

Prerequisites between issues are **GitHub issue dependencies**
(`GET`/`POST …/issues/{n}/dependencies/blocked_by`), one edge per prerequisite.
The edge is retained even when the prerequisite closes, so reopening it restores the block.
A prerequisite carried by a pull request is the packet issue that PR closes. The
"Dependencies" bullets in an issue body are commentary on those edges, never
the record. A packet is **ready** when it is an open leaf of the tracker tree
and every issue blocking it is closed; `local/bin/ready_packets.py` computes
that list, and the operator launches lanes from it rather than from a
hand-kept order or a dependency table in a comment (EVOLUTION.md 2026-09-04).
Establish or adopt each edge with
`local/bin/gh_common.py add-blocked-by ISSUE PREREQUISITE`. The command first
reads the edge, makes at most one mutation, and re-reads after an ambiguous
failure; it is therefore safe to repeat. Record closed prerequisites too.

Every GitHub call goes through `local/bin/gh_common.py` — a module for Python
callers, and for the shell scripts a CLI (`pr-view`, `post-status`,
`latest-statuses`, `ensure-pr-comment`, `post-review`, `merge-pr`,
`issue-create`, `add-blocked-by`, `issue-close`, `snapshot`, …; `--help` lists
them) owning CLI discovery, repository resolution, API version headers,
bounded retry of transient failures and the exit-2-with-stderr convention.
Nothing else shells out to `gh`. `issue_new.py`, `issue_close.py`, `pr_open.py`,
`ci.sh`, `review.sh`, `autofix.sh`, `pr_merge.py`, `github-sync.sh` take GitHub
numbers; `track.py`, `validate_tree.py` and `export_issues.py` are deleted.

Every repository-owned branch publication runs through `checked-push.sh` with
one explicit `refs/heads/...:refs/heads/...` mapping.  The helper reads the
remote tip with a short `ls-remote`, resolves the local ref's registered
worktree, and refuses a checkout whose HEAD or working tree differs from the
captured commit.  It runs that checkout's `.githooks/pre-push` against the exact
ref tuple before starting `receive-pack`, then pushes the captured commit under
an exact remote-tip lease.  The native hook performs a short defense-in-depth
comparison when selected, while the helper's lease makes a moved remote ref fail
closed even when that hook is stale or absent.  A caller's explicit
`MIPSTARRE_SKIP_HOOKS=1` remains the documented emergency bypass.  It skips
validation only: implicit tag following stays disabled, so publication remains
limited to the explicit branch mapping.

`github-sync.sh [ref ...]` takes branch names (default `main`), not a `push`
subcommand. It retains the post-publication record snapshot. When an explicitly
requested/default main push succeeded and the snapshot created a new telemetry
commit, it checked-pushes main once more without creating another snapshot.
Branch-only calls never implicitly publish main. Snapshot reads remain best-effort;
snapshot commit or final publication failure returns nonzero and leaves the
preserved local state for the operator to recover.

Every merge of `github/main` or a stack parent into an issue branch runs the
merge-loss guard before the merge commit is created. The guard compares the
pending index with `HEAD`, `MERGE_HEAD`, and every best merge base. It refuses
an incoming path that disappeared without a branch-side deletion and an
incoming-only entry restored wholesale to the unchanged branch blob. Paths
recorded by Git as conflicts remain resolution decisions. The
`reference-transaction` hook checks an automatic merge's commit object before
the branch ref moves; `pre-commit` checks the pending index for a merge
committed later. Neither path permits `MIPSTARRE_SKIP_HOOKS` to bypass this
check. A lane checking an existing merge uses the primary checkout's
`local/bin/merge_loss_guard.py --repo <worktree> --commit <merge>` so a stale
branch copy cannot weaken the audit.

* Branches: `issue-<github-number>-<slug>`, or `codex/issue-<number>-<slug>`
  from an agent; `pr_open.py` rejects what `git check-ref-format` would.
* Titles, slugs and branch names are **bracket-free**: bot-generated branch
  names inherit those characters and "`]` breaks part of the PR automation
  stack" (docs/CONTRIBUTING.md:122-124). A `:` in a *title* is fine
  (`Tracking: …`), but not in a branch.
* `autofix.sh`'s automated fix commits keep the exact subject prefixes
  `[codex-auto-fix]` and `[codex-review-fix]`; its iteration counter and the
  review skip key on them.  Operator and worker repairs use plain
  `fix(review): …` / `fix(ci): …` subjects so the reviewer sees them.
* `Closes #N` / `Fixes #N` auto-closes the issue on merge, `Addresses #N` does
  not (docs/CONTRIBUTING.md:61-62) — and the numbers being GitHub's, that
  footer is now literally what GitHub itself reads.

## 2. Evidence contracts

All evidence binds to the **exact head SHA** (DESIGN.md invariant 2).

**Commit statuses.** Ten canonical contexts, posted by `post-status`: one
`local-ci/<step>` per CI step (`build`, `blueprint-render`, `paper-gaps`,
`blueprint-sync`, `file-length`, `proof-debt`, `proof-evasion`,
`statement-origin`), plus `local-ci/summary` and `local-review/summary`.
`ci.sh` posts `pending` before each gate step and `success | failure | error`
after it; a gated-out step is a `success` saying it was skipped. The gate reads
the *latest* status per context (`latest-statuses`), never GitHub's combined
status, silent as that is about contexts never posted. The run manifest is one
PR comment marked `<!-- mipstarre-ci-manifest pr=N -->`, kept current by
`ensure-pr-comment`: evidence for humans, while the statuses are the gate.

**Review verdict.** One `COMMENT` review per head SHA, bound to `commit_id`,
carrying `<!-- mipstarre-review pr=N head=SHA -->`, the findings ledger, and the
line `VERDICT: APPROVED | COMMENTED | CHANGES_REQUESTED (code=…, prose=…)`.
Unchecked findings are ledger lines matching `^\s*[-*]\s*\[ \]`; clean means
`APPROVED`, or `COMMENTED` with none of them. Adverse verdicts post as `COMMENT`
too — a **single account** cannot approve its own pull request, so the review
event carries no authority — and adverseness travels in `local-review/summary`
(`failure` for unresolved findings), which is the gate's review evidence.

**Adjudication** (review.md §12) is a PR comment whose body starts with
`ADJUDICATION` and contains `head=<SHA>` for the current head, one disposition
line per remaining finding; `--adjudicated` takes nothing else.

**Idempotency.** Every publishing step is **at most one mutation**: a paginated
read finds the stable marker first and adopts that record instead of duplicating
it (`commentOnce`, issue-automation.yml:403-417, now guarding retries rather than
webhook redelivery); an ambiguous write stays pending for adoption.

## 3. The merge gate

Single-PR merges use `pr_merge.py <number>`; reviewed batches use `pr_train.py`
as described below. Workers never merge or publish main directly. A single-PR
merge is a REST `PUT …/pulls/{n}/merge` with the exact
`sha` guard, issued by `gh_common.merge_pr` and verified against the merge
commit's topology (two parents, the frozen head second), behind seven gates
that refuse by default:

1. the PR is open, unmerged and not a draft (`draft is False`, not merely
   falsy), and reports a head SHA, a head ref and a base ref;
2. the primary worktree is clean and on the base, and the local branch tip
   equals the GitHub head SHA — the merge must be of the bytes built here. After
   fetching the current GitHub base, the head is fresh when that base is its
   ancestor, or when every raw tree change from their merge base to the base is
   allowlisted passive telemetry: a regular non-executable (`100644`) `.md` or
   `.jsonl` file below `results/telemetry/`, or a generated regular
   non-executable `.json` file below the exact
   `results/telemetry/github-snapshot/` subtree. The check uses
   `git diff --raw -z --no-renames` so additions, deletions and both sides of a
   rename retain their paths and modes. Executable files, executable-mode
   changes, symlinks, code or unknown suffixes, malformed records, paths outside
   those boundaries, a missing merge base and every failed Git command block;
3. all eight `local-ci/<step>` contexts plus `local-ci/summary` are `success` on
   that exact SHA; a **missing** context blocks, because GitHub's combined state
   reads `success` for a commit carrying no statuses at all;
4. that SHA's marker-bound `COMMENT` review (or one carried forward per
   review.md §13) carries `VERDICT: APPROVED`, or
   `COMMENTED` with zero unchecked findings, **and** `local-review/summary` is
   `success` there;
5. no `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review stands on that head, from anyone;
6. no live fix lock for the branch (`locks/fix-<branch>.lock`, running holder);
   the count of `merge-base..head` commits whose subject starts with a §1 fix
   prefix is printed for the record and is not a gate;
7. every issue the PR body closes — all nine of GitHub's closing keywords, not
   just `Closes` — has no open sub-issue left.

`--adjudicated` waives gate 4's adverse verdict and nothing else, and only when
an exact-head `ADJUDICATION` comment backs it; gate 5 is never adjudicable.

**Merge subject.** Past the gates, the merge is given the subject
`Merge PR #N: <PR title> [lean +A -D]`, where A and D count the added and deleted
**code** lines of the `*.lean` files the PR changed against its merge base, and a
PR that changes no Lean code line reads `[lean 0]`. Comment-only lines — line
comments, and block, doc and module-doc comments, which nest — and blank or
whitespace-only lines are not counted; a line of code trailed by a comment is.
An added line is classified in the head blob and a removed line in the merge-base
blob, and added, deleted and renamed files all count (issue #574). The title is
sanitized, collapsed to one line and truncated to 80 characters, and the one-line
body names the frozen head SHA. They travel as the REST `commit_title` / `commit_message` merge keys, which
`gh_common.merge_pr` omits entirely when its optional arguments are absent. The
count is an **approximate** size signal for GitHub's commits page (issue #557),
never evidence: it is measured after every gate, nothing reads it back, its
comment scanner is deliberately simple and raises nothing, and a failed
measurement sends no wording at all — GitHub then titles the merge as it
always did, and the merge still happens. Closing keywords in the title are
defused first (`closes #900` reads `closes issue 900` in the subject): gate 7
checked the PR body and the branch commits, never the subject, so a merge commit
must not be able to close an issue whose open sub-issues nobody examined.
`pr_merge.py --check-only` prints the subject it would use, so the operator can
read it before the merge.

Afterwards a best-effort, non-fatal tail fast-forwards local `main` to the
remote merge commit; branch and worktree cleanup keeps its safeguards (local
dirt defers it with a warning).

### Reviewed merge trains

**Daemon admission (#593).** The active model-free daemon may schedule one
operator-approved JSON batch of at least two pinned PR numbers and exact head
SHAs, using `local/bin/daemon_train.py` and the deployment recipe in
`local/deploy/issue-593-daemon-reviewed-trains.md`. Its existing complete scan
must report each member `clean` at that SHA; a fresh head stays on the ordinary
single-PR path, and a claimed member is held. The scan is only a routing hint:
the adapter passes the operator's PR-to-SHA pins to `pr_train.py`. With its
member claims held, the train compares every authoritative gate result to the
requested pin and records the pins in the manifest; the publication verifier
rechecks them, including conflict-dropped members. A changed pin refuses the
batch even if its replacement head has independent green CI and review. The
train repeats every member's current-head, dependency and frozen-base gate
before combined CI and publication. The daemon blocks its own ordinary merges
and hourly/pre-merge telemetry commits
while the train runs synchronously. Before invocation, the adapter commits
pending telemetry and uses the existing `github-sync.sh main` to publish any
telemetry-only local main lead (including record snapshots), then checks exact
primary cleanliness. Every unpublished commit must change only allowlisted
passive telemetry paths and modes; a later reversal of a nontelemetry change
cannot make that history publishable. It refuses nontelemetry dirt or history,
or divergence; it does not reset or discard local commits. The owner coordinates
other primary telemetry
writers, including the required main status snapshot, during the train's
clean-primary publication window; their records must be retained outside the
primary until that window ends. A refusal, conflict or uncertain post-push
outcome holds the approved batch for manual reconciliation, never as a merged
PR. Hourly and pre-merge batching resume after the train; PAR=0 remains binding.

After independent review and deployment, the daemon/operator may invoke
`local/bin/pr_train.py N M [K ...]` from the clean primary checkout at
`github/main`. Development and tests use fixture repositories exclusively.
Every member passes the existing open, local-tip, exact-head CI, independent
review, changes-requested, fix-lock, and dependency gates. Repeat
`--adjudicated N` only for members with the existing exact-head adjudication
record. A precondition failure refuses the entire batch and names the member.
The individual-head base-ancestry requirement is replaced by mandatory CI of
the combined commit; member review evidence is neither copied nor rewritten.

The tool creates `train-<UTC-stamp>` and a private worktree under the runtime
cache, merging frozen member SHAs with two-parent merge commits in argument
order. A conflict aborts only that merge, verifies restoration of the accepted
train, and drops that member; fewer than two accepted members refuses the batch.
The primary merge-loss guard checks each accepted merge. Existing developer
branches and worktrees are preserved. Failed train worktrees remain for diagnosis.

`ci.sh --integration-head SHA --worktree PATH --base SHA` runs all eight steps
against the combined commit, using one locked build of the complete `MIPStarRE`
library and both axiom audits, `MIPStarRE.LDT.Test.AxiomAudit` and
`MIPStarRE.QPBT.Test.AxiomAudit`. This includes the root artifact
needed by publication's dynamic `checkdecls` import and all downstream modules.
It rejects skip flags and dirty or moved train
heads, and publishes no PR evidence. Its manifest and logs stay in the runtime
cache. Bootstrap and build telemetry are transferred to the primary telemetry
files after publication, refusal, or an unknown outcome so their appends cannot dirty the primary
during gating; the transfer and the train event use the canonical
`telemetry.py` writers, so they obey the locking every other session obeys. CI warming uses `--no-build` to avoid a nested build lock, and
step execution stops at its first failing command.

Publication uses `checked-push.sh --train-manifest PATH` with one explicit
train-to-main ref mapping. After preflight, it rechecks the combined CI manifest,
member gates and heads, primary cleanliness, and frozen main; the existing exact
remote-tip lease protects the final fast-forward. Because a recheck only reads
the member refs, the same atomic transport leases every verified member ref at
its verified value: a member that moved before the remote's ref advertisement
aborts the whole push, main included, and no member branch is ever rewound,
while a member that still matches is already up to date and sends no update
command. Hook bypass is forbidden.

**The publication contract (owner-authorized, 2026-09-18).** State it exactly,
because the guarantees differ from one another:

1. *Content.* Main only ever advances to an integration of the exact reviewed
   member SHAs, after every member gate, the combined CI and the frozen-base
   and cleanliness checks passed at the verified heads. This is enforced by the
   gates and by the atomic transaction's old-value comparison on `main`.
2. *Server-side atomicity covers the refs in the transaction.* That is `main`,
   plus any member ref the client actually sends. A member whose advertised
   value still equals its verified SHA is up to date, so Git sends no command
   for it and the remote holds no predicate for it. A lease is likewise a
   client-side comparison against the ref advertisement, not a server predicate.
3. *Residual window, accepted.* A member ref can therefore advance after the ref
   advertisement and before the remote commits `main`, and the transport still
   reports success. Publication then carries that member's earlier, reviewed
   head while the PR's tip has moved on; main is unharmed, and GitHub does not
   show such a PR as merged. The 2026-09-17 adjudication reproduced this
   ordering against a real `receive-pack`. Closing it would need server-enforced
   comparison of every member inside the same transaction, which this transport
   does not offer; the owner authorized the narrower contract on 2026-09-18
   instead of leaving the train unusable.
4. *Claims cover the window.* Every writer in this project — the main session,
   the daemon, and each Opus helper — claims a PR on the shared atomic claim
   list (`local/bin/claim.sh`, the repository copy of the meta session's
   `qpbt-claim.sh`) before touching it. The train claims every member with kind
   `train` and party `main` before the first gate reads it, refuses to start
   when a member is held by another writer (printing the holder line), and
   releases the claims once the transport and its re-verification have ended,
   on success, on failure and on every abort path. A claim is not a remote
   predicate; it is what keeps this project's own writers out of the window.
5. *Post-push re-verification detects a violation after the fact.* Immediately
   after a successful transport, the train re-reads every member ref from the
   remote and compares it with the verified SHA. A member that moved is a
   CONTRACT VIOLATION: the member, its verified SHA, the observed SHA and any
   claim-list holder line are printed and recorded in `publication.json` and in
   the train event, the train comment for that member is not posted — nothing in
   this tooling may mark a PR merged that this train did not merge — and the
   train run exits non-zero so the operator sees it. Main stays as published; it
   carries only verified content.

GitHub recognizes included PRs by ancestry; the tool closes no issue by hand.
It posts one idempotent train comment per member, records one merge event,
fast-forwards local main and its origin alias, and removes only the train branch
and worktree. A failure after publication is reported as such and requires
operator reconciliation; it must not be retried as a new merge. An ambiguous
push is reconciled against remote main: equality or verified ancestry containing
the train establishes publication. Failed reads, unavailable ancestry, and
negative ancestry in a shallow repository retain an explicit `unknown` outcome.
An unknown outcome is never a refusal or permission to retry. The runtime
`publication.json`, stderr, and telemetry retain that distinction; unresolved
worktrees and manifests remain available for operator reconciliation. Generated
branch names are single components accepted by external Lake-root bootstrap.
Deployment and
daemon wiring remain separate from development of this tool (issue #502).

### Main-cycle integration checkpoint

The active owner service records, at each bounded tick, the local `main` SHA,
the readable remote `refs/heads/main` SHA, primary cleanliness, transport
result, and the age and exact head of the oldest CI-and-review-eligible open
PR. A dirty primary, remote mismatch, unavailable transport, active fix or
transaction lock, missing configured Space allocation or external-zero gate, or a stale
candidate is
a HOLD reason; it is never silently converted into a merge attempt. After a
successful daemon-owned merge, the service re-reads remote `main` and records
the new SHA before the next tick. The service may invoke `pr_merge.py` only as
its daemon-owned final action after these checks; workers never merge directly.
Each tick has bounded Git/GitHub reads and records failures as HOLD rather than
exiting the loop. The cadence is monotonic: work time is subtracted from the
configured interval (default 300 seconds). Candidate records distinguish stale
exact-head PRs from fresh actionable PRs using `pr_merge.head_is_fresh`, the
same conservative predicate as gate 2b; `pr_age_s` is PR creation age, while
eligibility onset remains unknown unless separately observed.

## 4. Untrusted text

Issue and PR bodies are untrusted data, and **more** so now that they arrive
from GitHub: anyone with repository access, and every imported external report,
writes the fields that are echoed into generated markdown and interpolated into
agent prompts. All three parent workflows sanitized before interpolation, and
`wf_util.sanitize` is that step ported: strip control characters, break fenced
code with zero-width spaces, truncate to 200 characters for titles and 5000 for
bodies (issue-automation.yml:122-128).

Every LLM hook in `local/bin` carries the same four requirements: gate on
`MIPSTARRE_LLM_ENABLED != "false"`; read prompts from committed main
(`git show main:…`), never the branch under review (DESIGN.md:76-77); frame
sanitized text as data that must not be followed; and filter any model-proposed
label through the repository's label list. `audit_stale_issues.py` additionally
keeps its path-traversal rejection for externally sourced citations.

## 5. Environment, snapshot, archive

`MIPSTARRE_GH` is the path to `gh` (else `PATH`, else the documented user-local
location); `MIPSTARRE_GITHUB_REPO` overrides the `owner/name` otherwise read
from the `github` remote; `MIPSTARRE_FIX_CAP` (default 5) bounds `autofix.sh`'s
own loop only — the merge gate does not read it — and is operator-tunable with
the reason recorded in `results/telemetry/events.md`. The pre-commit budget
guard remains mandatory; main may authorize `MIPSTARRE_INFRA_OVERRIDE=1` only
through a recorded project-scope decision. Neither control creates an owner
blocker unless the proposed action independently crosses the permissions
boundary in section 6. `MIPSTARRE_LLM_ENABLED` and
`LOCAL_REVIEW_ENABLED` keep kill-switch semantics (DESIGN.md:73-75).

`github-sync.sh` pushes explicit refs and writes an atomic, paginated read-only
snapshot of open issues and PRs to `results/telemetry/github-snapshot/`
(and, since the push goes through `checked-push.sh`, commits that snapshot and
`results/telemetry/builds.jsonl` to the primary checkout so the next publish
finds a clean tree)
(`open-issues.json`, `open-pulls.json`, `metadata.json`; PRs filtered out of the
issue endpoint) — audit and recovery telemetry, never lifecycle input. The
retired trees stay archived under `results/telemetry/registry-archive/` (commit
c8f1999): read-only research data, never edited or read as active input.

## 6. Access-only owner inbox and main mathematical decisions

Pinned issue #500 is the permissions-only owner inbox: it receives only **actual
access or permission blockers requiring human action**, such as changing the
owner's files, the machine or its accounts, spending money, an owner-only GitHub
operation or CLI permission change, or acting outside this repository. Changing
the stated project goal also requires an owner decision there. Main decides
mathematical and internal workflow questions, including definition/game
proposals, review disposition and exhausted budgets, with rationale and evidence
recorded in `results/telemetry/design-decisions.md` and on #27 before further
work; a decision whose only risk is failing to finish the project is never a
blocker. Routine reports, watchdog and poller notes, and progress also go to #27.
Main owns plans, task selection, decomposition, dispatch order, individual
worker assignments and pipeline execution; meta provides guidance only.
Neither main nor a worker may bypass permissions, proof integrity, CI, review or
merge gates. Internal security questions belong to main; a credential/access
change that actually requires the human is an owner blocker, never a workaround.
Issue #26 is archived and receives no new comments.

Use one #500 comment per blocker. The visible part is at most ten lines in
plain words and has this form; ids continue after B11, so the next id is B12.

```markdown
<!-- owner-inbox id=B<n> -->
<!-- owner-inbox-status=open -->
### BLOCKER B<n> — <five-word title>
What is stuck: one line.
Options: A one line. B one line. (C one line.)
Recommendation: one line.
Reply: DECISION B<n>: <letter>
```

The reply letter must be one of the offered alternatives (`A`, `B`, or `C`).
Put any additional detail in a folded `<details>` block. The first HTML comment
is an immutable identity marker; pass it unchanged as the marker argument on
both creation and resolution:

```bash
python3 local/bin/gh_common.py ensure-pr-comment 500 \
  "<!-- owner-inbox id=B<n> -->" --body-file BLOCKER.md
```

`BLOCKER.md` starts with the separate `<!-- owner-inbox-status=open -->` line,
not the identity marker. After an owner reply, update that same body file to
`<!-- owner-inbox-status=closed -->`, add `RESOLVED B<n>`, and rerun the command
with the unchanged identity marker. This PATCHes the original comment instead
of creating a second comment for the blocker.

The owner decision at **2026-09-06T05:05Z**, recorded at **05:17:03Z**, explicitly
withdraws the posted-#26 human hold, **including B7 and B8** (issue #247/PR #260).
The 02:55:29Z delegation and its 02:58:41Z withdrawal remain historical records;
neither is the current rule. This new explicit decision, not quotas or role
guidance, transfers mathematical and internal workflow decisions to main.
B7 terminal disposition requires exact-head evidence and `review.md` §12: no
fifth full review, fabricated carry-forward or CI/proof/merge/access bypass.
An unresolved evidence requirement stays blocked internally, not automatically
escalated to the human. No mathematical result is declared solved without proof.

Under the owner's 2026-09-06T05:56Z guidance, main autonomously reassesses
useful parallelism every cycle, after completion/failure, newly unblocked work
or compaction, and before waiting or ending, without owner/meta prompts.
Main selects useful, disjoint successors, rechecks dependencies, ownership,
account capacity, service evidence and cumulative budgets, and reports concrete
constraints and the next admission condition. Idle reservations, duplicate
writers, completed sessions and filler do not qualify. The September 6
eight-to-eleven allocation is historical; current admission uses the configured
account caps in `sessions.md` section 4. Issue #505 retired queue #257 and native
leases; replenishment uses external `dispatch.sh` assignments.

Main remains Astra Ultra; routine workers use Sol Ultra and hard assignments use
Astra Ultra with an explicit reason under `local/model-policy.json`. Record
selection, rationale and observed outcomes separately from provider-measured
effort. Preserve the historical max/xhigh observations, raw provenance, sample
counts and unknowns in `results/telemetry/model-comparison/`; no benchmark,
probe, filler session or gate/budget relaxation follows from this guidance.

A source statement found to be mathematically false goes to main, not the owner
inbox, unless actual access or permission requires human action. Astra
availability has been reported, so main selects Astra Ultra for the
mathematical-gap lane through
`MIPSTARRE_CODEX_MODEL=gpt-6-astra local/bin/dispatch.sh --role mathfix --effort ultra`.
Historical owner-launched Fable measurements remain unchanged. Every request or
dispatch carries the exact source path, label and line range; the counterexample
or obstruction; the paper-gap note; the relevant blueprint dependency graph and
Lean consumers; and the cumulative session count and elapsed working time.

A correction is adopted only when it meets all four conditions below.

1. **Correctness:** the known counterexample no longer applies, adversarial
   checks find no replacement counterexample, and a mathematical proof sketch
   derives the corrected conclusion from its explicit hypotheses using cited
   source results.
2. **Sufficiency:** every use in the paper and every dependent node in the
   blueprint graph remains justified; checking only the first Lean consumer is
   insufficient.
3. **Minimality:** the correction is the closest sufficient statement to the
   source, with no unnecessary hypothesis or weakened conclusion and no change
   to the source semantics; "weakened" is judged against the proof as well as
   the source (`AGENTS.md`, *Bound strength*). A necessary definition/game
   correction first
   returns to main for a separately recorded decision and scoped task, with an
   explicit faithfulness audit and independent mathematical review. It is never
   silently adopted as the printed theorem or exempted from consumer analysis.
4. **Lean convergence:** the corrected statement type-checks and all affected
   downstream consumers compile. Lean success alone does not establish the
   preceding three conditions.

The ordinary budget is at most ten `mathfix` sessions
or about one and a half working days per gap, whichever comes first. The budget
is shared across the historical owner-launched Fable lane and the Astra lane; a
model or telemetry change does not reset it. If a correction requires changing
a mathematical definition or game, the worker stops and returns it to main
immediately. Main decides source-semantic corrections with the preceding evidence
and independent review; changing the stated project goal is outside main's
authority and requires an owner decision on #500.
At budget exhaustion, stop that lane and record attempted statements,
counterexamples, proof sketches and unresolved consumers on #27 and in the gap
note. Main decides whether to stop, rescope or record a separately bounded tranche
within existing authority. Workers never self-extend or reset attempts or time.
Owner-only permission, credential, access or scope/resource grants go to #500;
mathematical difficulty alone is not an owner decision, and recording a main
decision never substitutes for that owner decision on the goal. Already-posted
items await the owner unless explicitly returned to main, as B7/B8 were above.

**Recorded #118/B8 tranche (September 6 amendment):** main authorized
attempts **11 and 12**, each at most **2700 seconds**, on primary Astra **max**.
The carried baseline is **10 completed attempts / 19931 completed seconds**,
with original anchor **2026-09-05T19:24:00Z**. Attempt 12 is conditional on
main's recorded evaluation of attempt 11; it is not an automatic dispatch.
The maximum additional allocation is 5400 seconds, not time already spent.
Maintain a cumulative ledger of actual attempt times, failures, interruptions
and original session links. This exception is confined to that recorded tranche;
it does not grant attempt 13, a new anchor or unlimited renewals. Any later work
requires a new explicit main decision with evidence and a finite bound, not
another owner budget question unless actual access/permission is blocked.
See `sessions.md` §4.1 for unchanged continuation validation; this amendment
does not authorize editing historical limits or bypassing a dispatcher refusal.

An adopted correction follows the ordinary CI and independent-review gates. The
operator announces it in one line on progress log #27 and records it in the
paper-gap note, `results/telemetry/events.md`, and
`results/telemetry/design-decisions.md`. That announcement informs the owner; it
is not a request for a decision.

## 7. Duplicate-work guards

Two tasks covering the same mathematics, dispatched weeks apart, cost a prover
run, reviews, repairs and refresh attempts each before anyone noticed that
`main` already had the result (issue #576: PRs 212, 296, 398, 488, 539, 289 and
274 were the examples). Three model-free guards close that hole; all of them
read the local `github/main` ref and the registry, none calls a model.

**Before proof work.** `local/bin/dup_check.py check` searches a reference for
a declaration by exact fully qualified name, by last name component inside the
`MIPStarRE` namespace, and by statement after a cheap normalisation (comments
stripped, the proof cut at the top-level `:=`/`by`/`where`, binder names
renamed positionally, whitespace collapsed). It takes `--name`, a blueprint
node label with `--node` (its `\lean{...}` names), or a whole branch or open PR
with `--branch`/`--pr`, whose declarations *new against the merge base* are
checked. Exit 0 is clean, 3 means duplicates were printed as `file:line`, 2 is
a usage or environment error, and 4 is advisory — the reference is absent
locally, so nothing was checked and the run must not be read as clean. Every
subcommand that searches a reference (`check`, `sweep`, `claim`,
`claims-check`, `predispatch`) reports that case the same way. `--json` is the
machine form.

Every native delegate and every Opus helper runs it before starting or
repairing proof work on a declaration, and records the result in the session
note. A `statement` match is a signal to read both declarations, never by
itself a verdict — the tool compares text, not terms.

**Declaration claims.** `local/registry/declaration-claims.jsonl` is an
append-only registry binding declaration names to the issue producing them
(`local/registry/README.md` has the row format). `dup_check.py claim --issue N
--name X` records a claim and refuses (exit 3) when another issue's open claim
holds the name or when `main` already declares it; `claims-check` is the
read-only form, `claims-release` closes a claim once its PR merges, and
`claims-list` prints what is open. **Issue creation records the claim** for the
declarations the packet will produce, and **dispatch checks it**, so two open
issues cannot target the same declaration unnoticed. `--force` records a
refused claim anyway and still exits 3, so an accepted overlap stays visible in
the log rather than disappearing.

`dispatch.sh` runs `dup_check.py predispatch --issue N` for the `prover`,
`mathfix` and `simplifier` roles before the session starts. It is advisory by
default: exit 3 (`main` already has a claimed name) and exit 4 (nothing claimed
for that issue, or `github/main` is absent locally) both print a warning and
let the dispatch through. `MIPSTARRE_DUP_CHECK=fatal` turns exit 3 into a
refusal, and `=off` skips the check; a non-numeric `--issue` scope word has no
claim to check and is skipped with that explanation.

**Superseded-PR sweep.** `dup_check.py sweep` walks every open PR, parses only
the Lean files that PR touches at its head and at its merge base, and reports
the declarations new at the head that `main` already contains by name or by
normalised statement. It writes the Markdown report of `audits/` with
`--out`, exits 3 when any PR is flagged, and takes its PR list from a JSON file
with `--prs-file` instead of the GitHub read. The main session runs it before a
merge-train pass, so a superseded PR is closed or shrunk early instead of
repaired. A head branch not present locally is reported as skipped rather than
silently clean: the sweep never fetches on its own.

**Worker claims are separate.** `local/bin/claim.sh` is the atomic list that
stops two *workers* touching the same PR at once (the main session and a helper
both repaired PR 577 on 2026-09-17). It claims a PR or issue number for one
party and kind, refuses a second claim while one is open, and appends its
release line; the file is
`${MIPSTARRE_CLAIM_FILE:-${MIPSTARRE_CACHE_ROOT:-~/.cache/mipstarre-dev}/watchdog/meta-dispatched.txt}`,
append-only, in the format the meta session's copy writes. `dup_check.py`
answers "has this mathematics already been done"; `claim.sh` answers "is
somebody else doing this right now". Both are cheap and both are run first.
