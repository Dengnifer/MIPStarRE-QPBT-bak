# Protocol evolution ledger

Dated amendments to the protocols in this directory (and to `AGENTS.md`).
Every entry cites its trigger per `meta.md`. Newest last.

## 2026-08-30 — Founding: localization of the parent GitHub workflow

**Trigger:** project start (user directive): continue the self-evolved
workflow of LionSR/MIPStarRE with all GitHub operations replaced by local
ones; record telemetry for a research paper.

**Change:** created `local/` (DESIGN.md, protocols/, personas/, bin/),
`issues/`, `prs/`, `results/telemetry/`. `.github/` frozen as reference.
Initial protocols derived from a 7-reader study of the parent snapshot
(507e81220); the parent's post-mortem comments were ported as invariants
(single cache writer, review-after-green-CI, fix serialization + combined
iteration cap, trusted prompts, untrusted-data framing, bracket-free naming).

**Expected effect:** parity with the parent workflow's guard set from day one,
minus GitHub event plumbing, which becomes explicit script invocation.

## 2026-08-30 — Worktree bootstrap resets vendored packages

**Trigger:** events.md 2026-08-30 "Dirty vendored package blocks
`lake exe cache get`" (first build attempt failed).

**Change:** `worktree-setup.sh` resets dirty vendored package git trees
before `lake exe cache get`; the ProofWidgets fresh-state workaround from
docgen.yml:56-64 is kept alongside it.

**Expected effect:** cache fetch never aborts on inherited package dirt.

## 2026-08-30 — Fan-in data passed by path, not inline

**Trigger:** events.md 2026-08-30 "Workflow critic stalled on oversized
prompt" (study-fleet critic failure).

**Change:** orchestration rule in `sessions.md` scope: synthesis/critic
agents receive large upstream results as file paths to read, with inline
context capped; adopted for all future fan-in stages.

**Expected effect:** no stalled synthesis agents; reproducible fan-in cost.

## 2026-08-30 — Post-verification repair of drafted guards

**Trigger:** the founding verification pass (Fable verifier over the 7-builder
draft) live-demonstrated four defects and several dangling references; full
report archived in the session telemetry for 2026-08-30.

**Change:**
- `pr_merge.py`: review-verdict glob fixed to the `<sha>-*.md` files
  `review.sh` actually writes (the gate could never accept a reviewed PR);
  dead `fixes/pending` probe removed; fix-quiescence gate now probes the same
  mkdir lock `autofix.sh` holds (`locks/fix-<branch>.lock`, pid-liveness);
  cap env unified to `MIPSTARRE_FIX_CAP`.
- `autofix.sh`: releases its fix lock before the cap-time forced review
  (`review.sh` refuses to review under a live fix lock, so the terminal
  bot-fix commit was never reviewed).
- Machine-wide full-build mutex unified to `$CACHE_ROOT/.full-build-lock`
  across `cache-warmer.sh`, `warm-worktree.sh`, `ci.sh`, and the linter sweep
  (three uncoordinated locks before); `ci.sh` stale-break made
  liveness-first — a live owner is never broken by age (the initial build ran
  ~7 h against a 3 h age threshold).
- `MIPSTARRE_CACHE_DIR` → `MIPSTARRE_CACHE_ROOT` everywhere; octal-safe id
  parsing (`10#`) in `review.sh`/`autofix.sh`/`agent.sh` (ids 0008/0009
  crashed); `dispatch.sh` maps role `orc` → `orchestrator.md`; verdict files
  written atomically; template/persona citations no longer point at
  files that do not exist.

**Expected effect:** the merge gate accepts exactly the reviewed-and-green
PRs it was specified to accept; every full build contends on one mutex.

**Outcome (same day):** post-fix smoke reruns pass (see events.md).

## 2026-08-30 — Warmer seeds its first build from the primary checkout

**Trigger:** first live run of `cache-warmer.sh`: it cloned the primary repo
into `hot-main/repo` and was about to recompile ~9000 modules from source,
although the primary checkout already held a complete built `.lake` for the
same keyhash (events.md, "first warmer run").

**Change:** `cache-warmer.sh` gains `seed_hot_repo_lake`: when the hot
checkout lacks `.lake/build` and the primary checkout has one under the same
keyhash, `.lake/build` (and `.lake/packages` if absent) are cloned
copy-on-write before `lake exe cache get`/`lake build` — the local analogue
of the parent CI's restore-by-key-prefix (pr-ci.yml:144-160); the subsequent
`lake build` reduces to a trace check.

**Expected effect:** the initial warm costs minutes, not a duplicate
multi-hour compile; same mechanism covers re-seeding after a cache wipe.

## 2026-08-30 — Whitespace gate exempts byte-faithful paper mirrors

**Trigger:** the stage-2 commit of `references/qpbt-paper/` and
`references/neexp-paper/` was rejected by the pre-commit whitespace check:
the arXiv sources carry trailing whitespace and blank lines at EOF, and
normalizing them would break the mirrors' byte-identity claim (their whole
point). The LDT-era mirror never collided with the gate because it was
imported already-clean.

**Change:** `.githooks/pre-commit` runs `git diff --cached --check` with
`':(exclude)references/'`. Project prose and code keep the gate; verbatim
external sources do not.

**Expected effect:** mirrors commit unmodified; the fidelity claim in each
mirror README stays checkable forever.

## 2026-08-30 — Registry root resolves to the primary checkout

**Trigger:** running `ci.sh` from inside a PR worktree wrote the CI manifest
and `pr.md` updates to the worktree's own copy of `prs/` — a forked registry
(events.md would call this a split-brain record; caught during the stage-3
blueprint PR).

**Change:** `ci.sh`, `review.sh`, `autofix.sh`, `agent.sh` re-point their
repo root at the primary checkout via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`
(same resolution `cache-warmer.sh` and `telemetry.py` already used), so the
registry stays single-instance regardless of the invocation directory.

**Expected effect:** identical registry writes from any worktree; no forked
issue/PR records.

## 2026-08-30 — Paper-gap bibliography entries cite repository paths

**Trigger:** review round 4 of PR #0001 flagged the new `gap:` bibliography
entries for using repository paths where the parent policy expects published
site URLs.

**Change:** localized convention — with no public site, `gap:` entries'
`note` fields carry the in-repository note path (`docs/paper-gaps/…`);
`local/bin/site.sh` serves rendered notes locally. Recorded as a comment at
the entries in `blueprint/src/references.bib`.

**Expected effect:** reviewers and tooling treat repo-path citations as the
sanctioned local form; no dangling public URLs.

## 2026-08-30 — Review round cap with operator adjudication

**Trigger:** events.md, "Review loop non-convergent at the tail (PR #0001)":
five review rounds with finding counts 33, 26, 18, 12, 17 — the tail
oscillates because each round's fresh reviewer re-audits new text at
unbounded depth and cannot see prior adjudications.

**Change:** `local/protocols/review.md` gains: after **four** full review
rounds on one PR, the operator may adjudicate the remaining findings
instead of iterating — each remaining finding is either fixed, or ticked
in the current ledger with a written reason and converted to a tracked
issue; the merge may then proceed with `review_state: ADJUDICATED`
recorded in `pr.md` and the merge commit citing the adjudication. The
analogous parent mechanism is the combined bot-fix iteration cap with one
terminal review (pr-review.yml:69-72): iteration is bounded, the tail is
a human decision, and nothing is silently dropped — every unfixed finding
becomes an issue.

**Expected effect:** review loops terminate with an explicit, auditable
decision; stage-appropriate depth disputes move into the tracker instead
of blocking scaffolding merges indefinitely.

## 2026-08-31 — Merges auto-resolve registry-path conflicts with the base

**Trigger:** PR #0001's merge aborted twice on conflicts confined to
registry files (`prs/…/pr.md`, telemetry session captures) that the branch
had accumulated from earlier mis-rooted tool runs; aligning the branch's
registry to main went stale within minutes because `pr.md` mutates on main
continuously.

**Change:** `pr_merge.py` completes a conflicted merge automatically when
every conflicted path lies under `issues/`, `prs/`, or `results/telemetry/`,
resolving those paths with the base's version — correct by the
single-instance-registry protocol. Conflicts touching any other path still
abort untouched.

**Expected effect:** registry residue on branches can never block or
corrupt a merge; content conflicts remain a human decision.

## 2026-08-31 — Review lanes run in parallel

**Trigger:** stage-3 telemetry: ~30 h of PR #0001's wall time was the
review-fix loop, and each round ran the code and prose lanes sequentially
although they are independent per head SHA.

**Change:** `review.sh` dispatches the code and prose reviewer sessions
concurrently and parses sequentially. Failure semantics unchanged: a
code-lane crash blocks the PR (and reaps the still-running prose lane);
a prose-lane failure only warns. The parent ran the two as separate
parallel CI jobs (pr-review.yml), so this restores parent-level
concurrency the local port had serialized.

**Expected effect:** review wall time per round approximately halves.

## 2026-08-31 — Migration to ghz; main session handed to codex; GitHub mirror

**Trigger:** user directive: migrate the project to ghz:/home/drx/MIPStarRE-qpbt,
hand the orchestrating main-session role to a codex session there (GPT
models in place of Claude models), and mirror the repository to the private
GitHub monorepo Dengnifer/MIPStarRE-qpbt as the MIPStarRE-A/ subtree.

**Change:**
- `local/personas/main.md`: the main-session persona (operator role,
  operating loop, standing duties) — model-agnostic by construction.
- `HANDOFF.md`: state snapshot and immediate next steps at handoff.
- `local/bin/main-session.sh`: starts/resumes the interactive codex main
  session anchored at the repository root.
- `local/bin/github-sync.sh`: git-subtree mirror of main to GitHub
  (repo-scoped deploy key; full history under MIPStarRE-A/). The mirror is
  a surface only: issues, PRs, CI, reviews, and the registry remain local
  and authoritative; run the sync after each merge to main.
- macOS-only operational bits (caffeinate wake assertions) retire; the
  server does not sleep.

**Expected effect:** identical workflow semantics on the new host; the
model-family switch of the operator is a recorded telemetry datum, not a
protocol change.

## 2026-08-31 — Re-hybridization: GitHub-native issues/PRs for track A

**Trigger:** owner decision after the repository restructure (standalone
`Dengnifer/MIPStarRE-A` with its own PR space; umbrella
`MIPStarRE-qpbt` aggregates A and B as submodules). The founding
localization replaced GitHub because it was unavailable as a surface;
with it restored, the owner chose GitHub-native records.

**Change:** issues/PRs move to GitHub (seed migration:
`results/telemetry/github-migration-map.md`); CI and reviews continue to
EXECUTE locally and will post statuses/verdicts to the PR once the
tooling adaptation (HANDOFF.md step 0, owned by the incoming main
session) lands; `github-sync.sh` becomes a plain retry-hardened push;
the local registry becomes a write-through offline fallback,
authoritative in conflicts until the adaptation completes.

**Expected effect:** familiar review surfaces and separate per-track PR
management, at the cost of link-dependence for record operations — an
accepted trade recorded as a workflow-evolution datum: localization and
re-hybridization are both responses to the environment, which is the
paper's thesis in miniature.

## 2026-09-01 — GitHub becomes the workflow authority (lean port)

**Trigger:** owner decision 2026-08-31 (follow-on to the re-hybridization
entry); executed 2026-09-01 after the scope reset recorded below.

**Change:** The local issue tree and PR registry are retired.  GitHub
(`Dengnifer/MIPStarRE-A`) is the single source of truth for issues (native
sub-issues replace `parent`/`children` frontmatter), PRs, CI evidence
(per-step commit statuses `local-ci/<step>` plus `local-ci/summary` and
`local-review/summary` on the exact head SHA), review verdicts (COMMENT
reviews bound to a commit id — a single-account repo cannot self-APPROVE, so
adverseness travels in the failing `local-review/summary` status), and merges
(REST merge guarded by the exact-SHA `sha` parameter, verified by merge-commit
topology).  All GitHub traffic goes through `local/bin/gh_common.py`; shared
non-registry helpers moved to `local/bin/wf_util.py`.  `track.py`,
`validate_tree.py`, `export_issues.py`, and `local/labels.yml` are deleted —
GitHub provides what they reimplemented.  The registries were archived
verbatim first (`results/telemetry/registry-archive/`, commit c8f1999) and
stay read-only research data; `github-sync.sh` now also writes a read-only
JSON snapshot of open issues/PRs under `results/telemetry/github-snapshot/`
for offline forensics — never lifecycle input.

**Expected effect:** CI and reviews still execute locally on this machine;
GitHub stores the evidence.

## 2026-09-01 — Scope control for workflow changes (incident amendment)

**Trigger:** events.md 2026-09-01, the issue-0007 overbuild.  The first
implementation of the entry above grew, in ~17 hours and 21 commits, into a
+14.6k-line unreviewed rewrite of the whole layer — a 2,761-line bespoke
GitHub API client, a 643-line lock manager, a 5,649-line test suite wired
into the commit and push hooks (≈10 minutes per commit), an actor-verification
regime and a branch-protection evaluator nobody asked for — while the actual
product (the Lean formalization; PR #5's 17 findings) sat untouched.  The
owner paused the session, archived the branch as research data
(`telemetry/issue-0007-overbuilt`), and rebuilt the port lean.

**Change:** amendment (now also in `local/personas/main.md`):

1. The product is the Lean formalization.  `local/` is scaffolding; scaffolding
   work is a cost center, budgeted by default at ≤2 hours wall time and ≤400
   changed lines per episode.  Hitting the budget means stop, commit what
   stands, record the state, and escalate to the owner — not push through.
2. Git hooks must finish in under 60 seconds on a typical commit; heavier
   verification belongs to CI steps.
3. No new abstraction layers (API clients, lock managers, frameworks) and no
   rewrites of working, reviewed code without an explicit owner directive;
   prefer the smallest diff that satisfies the brief, and prefer `gh` + the
   REST API over reimplementation.
4. After any workflow change merges, the next dispatched work item MUST be a
   mathematics item.  Two consecutive workflow-only episodes require owner
   approval.

**Expected effect:** scaffolding episodes stay bounded and auditable, and the
work item after a merged workflow change is mathematics.

## 2026-09-02 — Issue #25 bounded reviewer lane

**Trigger:** Issue #25 and the PR #28 bootstrap review recorded in `results/telemetry/events.md`.
**Change:** Bound reviewer scope, context, model, effort, memory, and timeout.
**Expected effect:** Reviews stay focused while owner inbox #26 and progress log #27 remain current.
## 2026-09-02 — PR 7 review hardening (rounds 1-3)

**Trigger:** the three adversarial review rounds on the GitHub-native port PR
(#7).  Each round's findings ledger sits in the PR's published review; the
supporting record is `results/telemetry/` and the read-only
`registry-archive/` precedent for what evidence must be able to prove.

**Change:** every bypass the reviewer found is now closed mechanically.

1. A publishing CI or review run refuses a dirty worktree, and `ci.sh`
   re-checks both the local tip and the remote head immediately before
   publication — a status is a claim about one commit, and dirty bytes are not
   that commit.
2. `--base`, `--only`, and `--skip-build` runs are partial: they publish
   nothing at all.  `--base` joins the list because an overridden base empties
   the diff and marks every gate skipped-success.
3. The roll-up summary is invalidated (set `pending`) before a rerun, so a
   crashed run can never leave the previous `success` standing.
4. Green review evidence requires BOTH a clean `VERDICT` and a
   zero-unresolved findings ledger; a clean verdict over unresolved findings is
   inconsistent reviewer output, not a pass.
5. The merge gate adds gate 2b (fresh base): the head must contain the current
   base tip, and a failed base fetch fails the gate.
6. The fix-iteration cap fails closed on an unresolvable merge base rather
   than counting zero fixes.
7. The scope guard counts deletions and runs before the early exit, so a
   large-deletion or no-op-looking change cannot slip past the budget.
8. Review ledgers stay in runtime storage; the published GitHub review is the
   durable record.

**Expected effect:** evidence can only ever certify committed, pushed, current
bytes, and each bypass is closed by the tooling rather than by convention.

## 2026-09-02 — Merge-time fix cap retired; owner-gated controls enumerated

**Trigger:** the PR #5 stall recorded in `results/telemetry/events.md`
(2026-09-02, "PR #5 review-fix cap"): six hand-authored review-fix commits,
every CI context green and an APPROVED review with zero unresolved findings on
the exact head, yet `pr_merge.py` gate 6 refused because the branch carried six
`[codex-review-fix]` commits against a cap of five.  The operator escalated to
the owner: the gate text named "human attention" as the remedy and the standing
briefing forbade weakening a gate.  An owner-side audit (six read-only lanes,
three adversarial refuters) found no safety property behind the refusal.  The
episode is owner-directed — the owner approval `main.md` requires for a second
consecutive workflow episode — and the incident record is the events.md entry
of 2026-09-02 ("PR #5 review-fix cap"), committed on main (f94fe3c) before
this amendment and contained in the PR head.

**Change:**

1. `pr_merge.py` gate 6 no longer enforces a fix-commit cap.  The count is
   retired because it carries no evidence about the head: gates 3/4 already
   bind CI and the review — which covers the whole `merge-base..head` diff —
   to the exact SHA, so a converged PR is proven converged however many fix
   commits it took.  The count was also subject-prefix-based, not
   provenance-based (PR #5's six were hand-authored).  Bounding the automated
   loop is `autofix.sh`'s job; its pre-lock count race (issue #9) and its
   terminal-review gaps (issue #13) are loop defects, tracked there.  The lock
   probe stays, the merge-base computation gate 7 reuses stays (with a gate-7
   message), and the count is printed for the record.  `review.md` §12
   operator adjudication remains the convergence backstop.
2. `autofix.sh`'s cap note and `autofix.md` §5 address the operator, not "a
   human", and the doc matches the code (the label is not removed).
3. `.githooks/pre-commit` runs the scope-control budget before the
   `MIPSTARRE_SKIP_HOOKS` exit, so a blanket hook skip cannot launder the
   owner-only override.
4. `issues-prs.md` §3/§5, `review.md` (merge gate), `meta.md` §1 and
   `personas/main.md` name exactly one owner-gated control,
   `MIPSTARRE_INFRA_OVERRIDE`; every other parameter and remedy is the
   operator's with a recorded reason; an owner-blocked item becomes a
   `needs-owner` issue and the session continues with the queue.
5. Worker personas commit repairs under plain `fix(...)` subjects; the
   `[codex-*-fix]` prefixes are reserved for `autofix.sh` (they made
   `review.sh` skip PR #5's heads and forced four `--force-review` runs).
6. A regression test pins that six fix-prefixed commits with full evidence
   pass `--check-only`.

**Expected effect:** the merge gate never demands owner action while all
evidence is green on the exact head; the owner-gated set is exactly the
anti-bloat budget; a question for the owner parks one item instead of idling
the session.

## 2026-09-03 — Dispatch resume option ordering

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md` 2026-08-31, "Codex resume dispatch
rejected the worktree option" (tracked by issue #38): sanctioned session
`orc-0007-20260831-02` failed before agent start because `codex exec resume`
rejected the worktree option after the subcommand.

**Change:** `local/bin/dispatch.sh` now places all `codex exec` options before
the optional `resume` subcommand. `local/protocols/sessions.md` records that
CLI-ordering invariant, and `scripts/tests/test_dispatch.py` checks fresh and
resumed argv assembly deterministically.

The issue #38 review found that the new regression file was omitted from the
workflow line-budget path set and that its preflight depended on an installed
Codex CLI. A repository-wide search found `.githooks/pre-commit` to be the only
`INFRA_CHANGED` enforcement point. It now counts the dispatch test, while the
test places a temporary fake `codex` first on `PATH`.

**Expected effect:** fresh and resumed dispatches retain the same worktree,
sandbox, JSON capture, final-message, model, and configuration behavior, while
both conform to the installed Codex CLI grammar.

**Outcome:** read-only smoke sessions `scout-38-resume-smoke-20260903-01` and
`scout-38-resume-smoke-20260903-02` started in the issue #38 worktree, shared
thread `01a064b5-fb0a-77b0-830e-e106a44b1a8f`, and each completed with JSON,
a final message, and a successful telemetry record.

The review repair kept total issue-branch workflow churn at 145 changed lines,
below the 400-line limit, without `MIPSTARRE_INFRA_OVERRIDE`; the focused tests,
full Python suite, and pre-commit gate exercise the corrected budget and
hermetic test path.

## 2026-09-03 — Tier 2 becomes a shared read-only package store

**Trigger:** owner audit of disk use on ghz (2026-09-03): the project directory
had grown to 87 GB on a 97 %-full disk, 58 GB of it eight identical 7.3 GB
copies of `.lake/packages` (all 21 checkouts share one `lake-manifest.json`
and `lean-toolchain`); ext4 without reflink, so copy-on-write is unavailable.

**Change:**

1. `warm-worktree.sh`: tier 2 is linked from `$CACHE_ROOT/packages/<key>`
   (`key = sha256(lake-manifest.json ‖ lean-toolchain)[:16]`); the first
   warmer for a key still runs `lake exe cache get`, then publishes the tree
   (move, `chmod -R a-w`, symlink); later warmers only link. A pre-existing
   per-worktree copy is left in place with a warning.
2. `build-cache.md` tier-2 section and invariant 10 rewritten: the
   "never symlinked" rule is replaced by the read-only store, with the reason
   the old objection no longer applies (writes fail loudly instead of
   spreading). `ci.sh` already treated a symlinked `.lake/packages` as a
   read-only dependency tree.
3. Live migration performed by the owner: the primary checkout's tree was
   moved into the store and every identical worktree copy swapped for a
   symlink (same filesystem `mv` + `ln -s`, safe under running `lake`
   processes), reclaiming ~51 GB.

**Expected effect:** packages cost 7.3 GB once per manifest rather than per
worktree; new worktrees are ready in seconds without touching the network
(which was flaking from ghz on 2026-09-02); a Mathlib bump is a new store key,
never a mutation of a shared tree.

## 2026-09-03 — Two-round cap for workflow-only PRs; queue discipline

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md` 2026-09-03, "Eight-hour stall on
main": the operator fed a 107-line workflow PR to the reviewer three times
(5 → 10 → 11 findings), grew it to 400 lines to satisfy them, and left two
green PRs unmerged for hours.

**Change:** (1) the two-round threshold for workflow-only PRs is operator
discipline enforced by the owner's watchdog (a `review.sh` refusal was tried in
PR #79 and withdrawn: a corrected head needs an exact-head review before it can
be adjudicated); (2) `personas/main.md` gains the queue-discipline bullet (merge green
PRs first at every iteration; two rounds then adjudicate; never grow a PR to
satisfy findings; mechanism requests are out of scope); (3) `review.md`
section 12 records the two-round threshold for workflow-only PRs.

**Expected effect:** scaffolding PRs converge in two rounds or are decided;
green work merges at every iteration; the reviewer cannot drive scope growth.
## 2026-09-04 — Review evidence follows the diff (carry-forward across a fresh-base)

**Trigger:** owner operation of the loop with eight parallel lanes
(2026-09-03/04): each merge advanced `main`, gate 2b then required every other
green PR to merge `main` and re-run CI **and** a 15–25-minute reviewer round
for a byte-identical patch (PR #78 refused at 6f224bf minutes after its review
had passed); with N open PRs every merge cost N reviewer rounds.

**Change:** `review.sh` gains a carry-forward fast path (section 13): equal
`git patch-id` of `base...head` against an earlier reviewed head republishes
that head's verdict and ledger for the new head and posts the summary status;
adverse verdicts carry too; `--force-review` disables it.  `issues-prs.md`
gate 4 notes that a carried review counts.

**Expected effect:** a fresh-base costs one CI run (about two minutes) and no
reviewer time; the reviewer pool serves new patches only; merge throughput
scales with the number of lanes instead of collapsing under them.


## 2026-09-04 — Pre-commit budget exempts inherited main changes

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md` 2026-09-04 (owner override for a
merge commit): a fresh-base merge of `main` into a 130-line workflow PR staged
520 inherited workflow-layer lines and the budget guard refused the merge
commit; completing it would have required the owner override for content that
was already reviewed on `main`.

**Change:** `.githooks/pre-commit` measures a merge commit against `MERGE_HEAD`
only when that commit is contained in `refs/remotes/github/main`.  The PR's own
cumulative workflow-layer diff and merge-time edits remain budgeted, inherited
main content counts zero, and side-branch merges remain measured against `HEAD`.
Regression tests exercise both kinds of merge; ordinary commits are unchanged.

**Expected effect:** fresh-base merges do not need the owner override solely for
inherited main content; the budget keeps binding the PR's own changes, and the
review reads the PR diff.

## 2026-09-04 — Packet tree under #47; prerequisites become issue dependencies

**Trigger:** owner decision on #159 (2026-09-04, after studying
LionSR/MIPStarRE#449), and `results/telemetry/owner-log.md` 2026-09-04 07:25Z
and 08:35Z, where lane order was carried by hand against tables kept in
comments on #47 — "#125 (operator BLR, stacked on #124)", "Opus prover pilot
started on #102 (stacked on #101)" — while #47 itself had grown to 50 flat
sub-issues (19 closed) and two open packets (#146, #156) had no parent at all.

**Change:** (1) five chapter trackers (#163 games, #164 test, #165 observables,
#166 combining, #167 extraction) are now open sub-issues of #47. The 35 direct
tracker children migrated then were #63, #77, #97-#99, #106-#121, #123-#125,
#127-#135, #146 and #156; #77 retained its five nested rigidity packets #101-#105.
Closed foundation packets such as #100, #122 and #126 remained direct children
of #47, whose body became an index over its trackers.
(2) Every open packet's prose prerequisites are transcribed into `blocked_by`
issue dependencies (69 edges) and the bullets are demoted to commentary by a
line in the body itself. (3) `local/bin/ready_packets.py` walks that tree and
prints the open leaves whose blockers are all closed (`--all`, `--json`,
`--root`), covered by `scripts/tests/test_ready_packets.py` against a fake API.
(4) `issues-prs.md` §1 makes the edges normative and names the script as the
launch list; `local/README.md` documents the command.

**Expected effect:** the operator launches from a computed list instead of
re-reading a comment; a merged packet unblocks its dependents with no edit
anywhere; the rooted traversal reports the tracker hierarchy and its leaves.

## 2026-09-04 — Supported prerequisite writes and complete readiness budgeting

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md` 2026-09-04 15:12Z, recording issue
#177 and the two workflow findings deferred from PR #171.

**Change:** `gh_common.py` and `issues-prs.md` add the supported
`add-blocked-by ISSUE PREREQUISITE` lifecycle command. It adopts an existing
edge before writing and re-reads after an ambiguous POST. The pre-commit
infrastructure budget now counts `scripts/tests/test_ready_packets.py`, with a
hook-level regression that stages 401 lines at that path.

**Expected effect:** operators can create the prerequisite record without an
ad hoc GitHub mutation or a duplicate edge after retry, and future readiness
test growth remains subject to the owner-gated 400-line episode budget.

## 2026-09-05 — Complete pre-push checks before transport startup

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md` 2026-09-05, "Pre-push gate outlived
the GitHub transport" (issue #157).

**Change:** `checked-push.sh` preflights one explicit branch ref before starting
`receive-pack`; `pr_open.py`, `github-sync.sh`, and both autofix push paths use
it.  `issues-prs.md` makes this the repository-owned publication contract.

**Expected effect:** long Lean gates no longer turn a successful hook into exit
141, while gate failures still publish no ref and exact-head CI remains intact.

## 2026-09-05 — Branch-private Lake products may use a separate volume

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md` 2026-09-05, issue #190 and PR #198.
**Change:** `MIPSTARRE_LAKE_ROOT` uses `<root>/<branch>` for one-component branches;
the helper rejects protected overlap and duplicate ownership, and dispatch grants its target.
**Expected effect:** native relocation without cache corruption or leaked build data.

## 2026-09-05 — Bind checked publication to the preflight tuple

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md` 2026-09-05, "Checked push did not
bind publication to preflight" (round-1 review of PR #197).

**Change:** `checked-push.sh` publishes the captured commit object and asks the
native pre-push hook to compare Git's single advertised tuple with the captured
preflight tuple.  Local or remote ref movement fails closed.  A caller's plain
`MIPSTARRE_SKIP_HOOKS=1` continues to request the documented emergency bypass.

**Expected effect:** the ref update that passed the long gate is exactly the one
offered to the remote, while operators retain the explicit recovery path.

## 2026-09-05 — Mathematical repair precedes owner escalation

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/owner-log.md` entries at 2026-09-04 22:35Z and
23:05Z and the corresponding `results/telemetry/events.md` owner-rule entry;
issue #208 records the confirmed defaults, and PR #209 reviews exposed missing
launch and accounting guards.

**Change:** `issues-prs.md` defines the bounded repair and escalation rule. The
owner launches Fable 5.1; `dispatch.sh` enforces astra with ultra effort for the
future Codex lane; the activation poller is archived under `owner-tools/`; and
`meta.md` specifies owner-session accounting. The paper-gap policy points to
the rule, and `local/README.md` points to the design-decisions register.

**Expected effect:** the fleet resolves theorem-statement defects against their
complete dependency graph, while #26 receives only definition/game decisions or
an evidence-backed nonconvergence packet after the shared budget is exhausted.

## 2026-09-05 — Make checked publication independent of hook selection

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md` 2026-09-05, "Checked publication
relied on ambient native-hook selection" (round-3 review of PR #197).

**Change:** `checked-push.sh` now binds the captured remote tip with an atomic
lease and preserves fast-forward-only publication.  Native confirmation accepts
an already-current ref, its test module is budgeted, and installation guidance
routes full checks through the helper.

**Expected effect:** stale, absent, or redirected native hooks cannot weaken the
validated tuple, while idempotent publication and full-mode guidance remain
usable.

## 2026-09-05 — Bind preflight files to the captured local commit

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md` 2026-09-05, "Checked push validated a
different checkout" (round-4 review of PR #197).

**Change:** `checked-push.sh` resolves the registered worktree owning the local
ref, requires its HEAD and status to match the captured commit before and after
preflight, and runs the gate from that checkout.  A two-worktree regression
binds the checked payload to the published ref.

**Expected effect:** publication cannot approve bytes from main while pushing a
feature commit, and dirty, detached, or unregistered ref checkouts fail before
transport startup.

## 2026-09-05 — Prevent implicit refs in checked publication

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md` 2026-09-05, "Checked push published
an unvalidated tag" (round-6 review of PR #197).

**Change:** the final validated push overrides `push.followTags` and passes
`--no-follow-tags`; a regression exercises an annotated tag with native hook
selection disabled.

**Expected effect:** the transport can publish only the branch tuple that passed
preflight, regardless of repository or user follow-tag configuration.

## 2026-09-05 — Keep the emergency bypass ref-scoped

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md` 2026-09-05, "Emergency bypass
broadened a checked push" (round-7 review of PR #197).

**Change:** the bypass path now disables implicit tag following just like the
validated path.  The publication protocol and operator documentation clarify
that bypass controls validation only, not ref scope.

**Expected effect:** `MIPSTARRE_SKIP_HOOKS=1` can recover from local tooling
failures without publishing any ref outside the requested branch mapping.

## 2026-09-05 — Blueprint citations use labels; reviewers derive spans

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md` 2026-09-05 "Blueprint numeric
locator churn", consolidating issue #174, PR #152's nine stale-span findings,
four same-day merge conflicts, and the earlier PR #29 locator regression.

**Change:** `AGENTS.md` makes blueprint labels the stored Lean-docstring
citation form. `scripts/blueprint_citations.py` resolves active labels to
current statement/proof spans and conservatively rewrites legacy locators.
`review.sh` loads that helper from the committed trusted ref, attaches its
derived map as untrusted review data, and the review prompts and protocol no
longer treat numeric drift as a finding when the intended label resolves.

**Expected effect:** blueprint insertions no longer force edits or review
findings in unrelated Lean files, while reviewers retain exact current source
locations and still detect missing, duplicate, or incorrect anchors.

## 2026-09-05 — Blueprint citation evidence gets a reserved budget

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md` 2026-09-05, "Citation evidence
starved by the review diff", recording PR #202 round 1 findings F6 and F7.

**Change:** `review.sh` sanitizes the branch-derived citation map into a
separately capped artifact, attaches it before the diff, and uses only that
artifact in the no-dispatch fallback. `review.md` section 4 makes the default
30000-byte allowance and ordering part of the untrusted-data protocol.

**Expected effect:** reviewers receive bounded label-resolution evidence even
for large patches, and neither review path interpolates raw branch-derived map
content.

## 2026-09-05 — Citation failures survive evidence truncation

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md` 2026-09-05, "Citation failures lost
inside their own evidence budget", recording PR #202 round 2 findings F4 and
F5.

**Change:** the resolver compacts repeated citation origins and gives unresolved
and duplicate rows priority over successful resolutions when producing a
bounded map. It fails closed when those failure rows cannot fit. Both dispatcher
and no-dispatch review prompts attach the sanitized map before the diff.

**Expected effect:** a large citation map cannot hide the entries that block
review, and attachment order no longer depends on which review path executes.

## 2026-09-05 — Reject silent loss from branch-integration merges

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md` 2026-09-05, "incident: silent file
loss on stacked branches 109 and 110" (issue #222). Merge commits `35bdc2a`
and `8ad1de8` had trees identical to their first parents even though their
second parent added five modules and changed two existing modules.

**Change:** `merge_loss_guard.py` compares a pending index, or an existing
two-parent merge, with both parents and every best merge base. It blocks an
incoming path deleted without a branch-side deletion and an unambiguous
incoming-only change restored to the unchanged branch blob. Recorded conflict
paths remain ordinary resolution decisions. `.githooks/reference-transaction`
audits an automatic merge object before its branch ref moves, while
`.githooks/pre-commit` checks a prepared merge's index; neither permits the
blanket bypass to skip the guard. Focused tests cover the historical whole-tree
failure, an intentional branch deletion, recorded conflict resolution,
multiple merge bases, both hook paths, and committed-merge auditing.

**Expected effect:** resetting a prepared merge index to `HEAD` cannot create a
quietly lossy stack or fresh-base merge, while deliberate branch deletions and
conflict resolutions remain possible.

## 2026-09-06 — Record explicitly selected Codex models

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md` 2026-09-06, "Codex session rows omit
the selected model" (issue #231).

**Change:** `dispatch.sh` forwards its nonempty `MIPSTARRE_CODEX_MODEL` override
to `telemetry.py`, and the session schema admits that exact value as optional
`model`. Rows created without an explicitly resolved model continue to omit the
field; historical rows are not rewritten.

**Expected effect:** new explicitly pinned sessions retain their model identity
without changing Codex selection behavior or inventing values for CLI-default
sessions.

## 2026-09-06 — Reserve dispatcher capacity per account

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md`, "2026-09-05 — Two accounts and router
shim (recorded 2026-09-06)", and the September 6 model-identity incident (#231).
The owner authorized issue #232 to subsume #231.

**Change:** `sessions.md` §4.1 specifies locked per-account PID reservations,
ratio-based auto selection, bounded waits, and resume affinity. `dispatch.sh`
and its `account_router.py` helper implement that contract; `telemetry.py`,
`meta.md`, and `DESIGN.md` record selected account/model identity. Review and
autofix pass account environment variables through. Model comparison prefers
explicit registry data while retaining historical fallback. This extends the
earlier #231 amendment by resolving and pinning account-config model defaults.

**Expected effect:** concurrent dispatchers do not race for the same capacity;
resumes stay with their original account and telemetry retains their identity.
Timeout remains an explicitly authorized overflow, not a hard-cap guarantee.
Operator cutover after merge restores the v1 multi-agent-off-only shim and sets
the aggregate `max-codex` to the sum of the two configured caps (19 by default).

## 2026-09-06 — Make main turns snapshot-driven and delegation-first

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md` 2026-09-06, "Main-turn work serialized
detached recovery", and owner directive #234.

**Change:** `local/personas/main.md` now starts each short turn with the status
snapshot, delegates work exceeding about two minutes, and orders recovery,
labelled autofix or adjudication, stack propagation, and critical ready-packet
dispatch. It makes daemon-only merges and #27 live-worker reporting explicit,
with #26 reserved for human decisions.

**Expected effect:** the main session remains responsive while independent work
advances in parallel, failed lanes receive prompt recovery, and merge authority
and owner escalation stay unambiguous.

## 2026-09-06 — Align the useful-worker floor and posted owner decisions

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md` 2026-09-06, "Standing worker floor
and posted-inbox policy drift (#247)", and the owner correction recorded at
2026-09-06T02:58:41Z, withdrawing the 02:55:29Z delegation.

**Change:** `local/personas/main.md` assigns plans and execution to main, with
meta guidance-only, and states the 8–11 useful-live-worker floor excluding main,
completion anticipation, prompt replenishment and honest constraint reporting.
It aligns session guidance with primary/gpt-6-astra/max and fan-out disabled.
`issues-prs.md` §6 distinguishes routine decisions before escalation from every
already-posted #26 item, including B7, which must await the human owner.
Mandatory escalations, proof budgets, account limits and all gates remain intact.

**Expected effect:** sustain useful parallel work without filler or inferred
owner approval. This is a documentation-only proposal on the issue branch, not
an unreviewed installation into main; the owner correction already applies via
standing guidance. Normal publication, CI, independent review and merge remain
required outside this session.

## 2026-09-06 — Select worker effort from useful-work observations

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md` 2026-09-06, "Owner-selected effort
and bounded initial comparison (#247)", the 03:26:22Z effort correction and
03:36:00Z research priority in
`results/telemetry/model-comparison/owner-priority-20260906.md`.

**Change:** `local/personas/main.md` and `issues-prs.md` retain main at `max`
while main selects `max` or `xhigh` for new/resumed primary Astra workers.
They preserve the useful-worker allocation with honest temporary service
constraints and require evidence-led, normally reviewed refinement. The initial
`results/telemetry/model-comparison/astra-effort-20260906.md` and JSON dataset
separate two useful review attempts from six historical configuration probes;
neither project attempt has server-verified effort. No historical row is changed.

**Expected effect:** preserve auditable effort/quality observations without
inferring causal effects, inventing missing usage, or relaxing proof/review
budgets. This supersedes only the earlier mandatory-max worker clause, not the
main/meta, floor or posted-inbox authority boundaries. Issue #237 retains its
README/runtime work; reconcile overlapping policy edits through normal
integration only after PR #238 actually merges, never by installing this draft.

## 2026-09-06 — Normalize astra effort requests to xhigh

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md` 2026-09-05, "Incident: astra sessions
ran at medium effort", measured before the 22:25Z handoff and confirmed on both
Codex endpoints at 22:40Z; and the owner's 2026-09-05T22:45Z decision that astra
must request `xhigh` while sol retains `ultra` (issue #237).

**Change:** after account routing resolves the exact model, `dispatch.sh` maps
omitted or legacy `ultra` effort to `xhigh` only for astra. Other explicit astra
efforts and every sol effort remain unchanged. The `mathfix` guard validates the
normalized astra `xhigh` request. `telemetry.py` and the session schema record
the nonempty effective CLI request as optional `requested_effort`, explicitly
distinct from provider-measured behavior. Session, math-fix, review, architecture,
and model-comparison documentation now state the same model-specific policy.

**Expected effect:** both astra accounts receive the highest effort they honour,
sol keeps its established request, legacy callers remain valid, and future
session rows preserve what the dispatcher asked for without overstating what the
provider executed.

## 2026-09-06 — Primary relay and literal Astra max

**Trigger:** issue #237 / PR #238; the owner's primary-relay/max decision and
the incident entry "PR238 primary relay/max amendment" in `events.md`.

**Change:** `account_router.py` reads primary/both mode at every admission,
reconciles host processes with reservations, accounts for main and other key
use within twelve primary slots, and rejects disabled accounts and saturated
timeouts. Secondary threads require a fresh primary checkpoint continuation
with linked history and the original shared mathematical budget. `dispatch.sh`,
review and autofix request only `gpt-6-astra` at `max`, with fan-out disabled;
missing dispatchers cannot trigger direct fallback. Session, model, mathfix and
main-persona policies are synchronized. The owner-authorized profile/shim
mitigation is installed atomically; future launcher/supervisor versions are
prepared but not started. No credentials or historical measurements change.

**Expected effect:** no secondary spillover, timeout overbooking, Sol launch,
or effort-request ambiguity. Both-account settings survive for an explicit
later owner decision; unobservable host state blocks admission.

## 2026-09-06 — Eleven-worker allocation and continuation review repairs

**Trigger:** owner allocation, PR238 F1–F4, and "PR238 allocation and review repairs" in `events.md`.
**Change:** exact interactive exclusions, rejection of fan-out overrides,
cumulative completed-time charges, resume provenance and durable replay snapshots.
**Expected effect:** eleven allocated workers plus main without touching exempt
sessions, and no budget reset or provenance loss across resumes or append failures.

## 2026-09-06 — Preserve selected worker effort and tolerate historical damage

**Trigger:** 03:26 UTC owner update and PR238 F5; `events.md`, "PR238 F5 and per-worker effort selection".
**Change:** dispatch/review/autofix/shim honor main's max/xhigh choice; main stays max;
omitted/legacy ultra map to max, other values fail. Shared history parsing tolerates
non-record damage but validates relevant continuation metadata; budget rules persist.
**Expected effect:** ordinary resumes recover, explicit xhigh survives, verification stays honest.

## 2026-09-06 — Integrate standing policy after the routing merge

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md`, "Issue247 integration after actual
PR238 merge", and the assignment following GitHub merge `32a32ede`.

**Change:** the issue branch preserves both parents' amendment histories and
reconciles `issues-prs.md` with the now-active Astra mathfix lane. Main retains
max/xhigh worker selection, the eleven-worker cap, useful-floor constraints and
human authority over every posted #26 item, explicitly including B7 and B8.
The comparison README restricts historical claims to the six recorded probes;
an integration note links the byte-preserved API/Ultra finding and original
meta role correction without changing policy or research sample counts.

**Expected effect:** a normal PR can review the standing-owner alignment against
the actual routing merge without importing private primary history, changing
runtime code, inferring server effort or bypassing CI/independent review.

## 2026-09-06 — Access-only escalation and bounded main authority

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md`, “Access-only owner escalation
supersedes posted B7/B8 holds”, records the owner decision at 05:05Z, received
at 05:17:03Z, and the explicit main tranche supplied to `orc-247-20260906-04`
for issue #247/PR #260. This supersedes the 02:58:41Z posted-inbox hold; earlier
entries remain historical evidence, not current policy or retroactive consent.

**Change:** main/mathfix/orchestrator personas and issues-prs/sessions/review/
meta/autofix protocols route mathematical and internal workflow decisions to
main, including posted B7/B8; only actual access/permission blockers needing
human action go to #26. Main records rationale and evidence; workers do not
self-extend. The ordinary ten-attempt/about-one-and-a-half-working-day limit
remains. The explicit #118 exception is attempts 11/12 at most 2700 seconds
each, with 12 conditional on main's evaluation of 11, preserving the supplied
ten attempts/19931 completed seconds and 2026-09-05T19:24:00Z anchor. No new
tranche or reset is automatic. Unchanged continuation checks still reject
changed historical limits; authorized new dispatches carry the complete ledger.
B7 disposition still requires exact-head CI/review/finding evidence, with no
fifth full review or forged carry-forward. Definition/game proposals return to
main without weakening the mathematical correction and independent-review bar.

**Expected effect:** obsolete human holds no longer stall internal decisions,
while normal hooks, proof integrity, review caps and exact-head merge gates
remain binding. No runtime routing changes, primary-main installation,
subagents, new research samples, proof claims or merges are part of this
amendment; the useful-worker floor/cap and effort-selection history are retained.

## 2026-09-06 - Make useful-parallelism reassessment a standing main duty

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md`, "Standing autonomous
useful-parallelism reassessment", records the 05:56Z owner guidance supplied to
`orc-247-20260906-06` for #247/PR #260.

**Change:** `local/personas/main.md` integrates reassessment into every cycle,
completion/failure, newly unblocked work, compaction and pre-wait/end decision;
`issues-prs.md` states the same responsibility. Main acts without owner/meta
prompts, targets eleven useful workers plus main with floor eight, and keeps
bounded useful assignments available to the durable replenisher. Below target
or floor, report current count, concrete constraint and next admission condition.
Queue #257 remains an implementation issue whose operation requires evidence.

**Expected effect:** timely useful replenishment and explicit admission
constraints without duplicate work, idle filler or repeated reflective messages.
The 05:05Z access-only authority, historical records, primary/Astra policy,
fan-out prohibition, budgets, caps and exact-head gates remain binding.

## 2026-09-06 — Main-selected useful-work queue with adoption holds

**Trigger:** #257; `events.md`, "Explicit useful-work admissions need durable
handoff reservations" (`orc-257-20260906-01`, continued as `-02`).
**Change:** `useful-queue.md` and queue/router/dispatch/review guards add explicit
one-shot packets, parent-merge bindings, ceiling ten, two-slot reviews, adoption
holds and stop-without-kill. Runtime stays outside git; only main selects work.
**Expected effect:** no overbooking, duplicate writers, stale/fifth-round reviews
or blind retries. Process counts are not server admission. Normal CI/independent
review precede deployment; this amendment does not install or start anything.

## 2026-09-06 - PR269 F1-F3 repairs
**Trigger:** `events.md`, "PR269 first-review repair". **Change:** canonical worktree
identities, diagnostic-only refusals and preserved Lake-root export; consolidate
duplicate protocol exposition under `useful-queue.md`. **Expected effect:** correct
reservations and holds within the original episode cap; deployment remains gated.

## 2026-09-07 — Space-cap5 merge-service checkpoint

**Trigger:** `events.md`, "space-cap5 merge-service checkpoint"; legacy daemon
v8 remains SIGSTOPped after its recorded SSH reset. **Change:** the bounded
owner service records local/remote `main` SHAs, primary dirt, transport and
lock state, the oldest exact-head CI/review-eligible PR age, and the concrete
HOLD reason before delegating any merge. Space capacity 5 and external gate 0
are required; successful daemon-owned merges re-read remote `main`. **Expected
effect:** dirty-primary and stale-head stalls remain visible, and no worker or
 manual path can merge around the exact-head gate. Git/GitHub reads are bounded,
 per-tick failures become HOLD records, cadence is monotonic, and stale and
 fresh candidates are reported separately without claiming an eligibility onset.

## 2026-09-06 — Scoped native QPBT allocation switched to space/cap5

**Trigger:** owner switch receipt `space-cap5-switch-20260906.json` and
`events.md`, "space five-total native allocation". **Change:** the active QPBT
queue now counts the main once plus at most four actual native descendants on
the `space` account; external admission stays zero. Completion/failure/
unblock/compaction events require prompt disjoint successor reassessment, with
vacancy duration and concrete reasons recorded. Relay-1/cap8 observations
remain historical and are not reclassified. **Expected effect:** no stale
account labels or occupancy claims while preserving all proof, review, CI and
merge gates.

## 2026-09-06 — Literal Ultra and shared native accounting

**Trigger:** PR287's owner-authorized native workflow repair, following the
space/cap5 switch recorded above; historical relay-1 and cap8 observations remain
unchanged. **Change:** external dispatch, review, autofix, shim and useful-queue
effort checks require literal Ultra. A native root lease charges its verified
shared descendant cap against the same owner allocation, while native telemetry
retains unknown usage aggregation and explicit key labels. The nonce-bound native
review transport re-derives exact-head evidence from the live root, and session
policy records disjoint successor chains and activity-based vacancy reasons.
**Expected effect:** native mathematics and independent review can proceed under
the current space five-total allocation without stale account labels, double
admission, or manufactured review receipts. CLI Ultra selection is not a claim
about backend compute equivalence.


## 2026-09-06 — Conservative Astra prompting and descriptive PR labels (#291)

**Trigger:** Owner migration/order and missing-label reports; events.md entry
"Conservative Astra instructions and PR label publication" records the completed
prior repair, conflicting persona instructions, and 22 unlabeled open PRs.

**Change:** main.md uses bounded event-driven checks, useful shared-capacity
delegation, autonomous follow-through and calibrated validation. issues-prs.md
records descriptive-label inheritance and the new pre-publication classification
requirement, plus the current permission-only owner-inbox boundary. PR290 owns
the existing native route/lease/review implementation; its mechanics are unchanged.

**Expected effect:** Fewer repeated scans and stale-instruction pauses; new or
adopted PRs carry descriptive labels without implicitly enabling automation.
**Outcome:** Pending focused tests, ordinary gates, and post-restart observation.


## 2026-09-06 — Publish the final main snapshot in an explicit sync (#291)

**Trigger:** events.md "Snapshot publication regression in migration #291";
real-Git regressions show the valid main sync returned success with local main
ahead because it committed the record snapshot after publication.
**Change:** github-sync.sh retains the snapshot timing and, only after a successful
requested main push and snapshot commit, checked-pushes main once more. Branch-only
scope is unchanged; commit/publication failures return nonzero. issues-prs.md
documents the argument and outcome contracts.
**Expected effect:** An explicit successful main sync leaves its own snapshot
published, so the merge service does not stall on that avoidable local-only commit.
**Outcome:** Nine offline tests pass; three baseline regressions demonstrate the
old failure. Final CI/review and deployed observation remain pending.

## 2026-09-07 - Audit-qualified bounded model routing (#301)

**Trigger:** Owner instruction and the independent C01/C02 audit/validation,
recorded in events.md under issue #301; no blanket Sol capability claim.
**Change:** Published-main model policy permits only root-issued exact nonsemantic
cleanup recipes, bounded to two existing Lean files/twelve changed lines.
Shared selectors validate class/model/Ultra, root-issued request and native
assignment provenance; exact artifact checks retain normal CI/Astra-review/merge
gates. Requested/selected/observed model fields are distinguished. Root/default
Astra, allocation, permission, credential and external-zero guards are unchanged.
**Expected effect:** Use only demonstrated bounded execution without delegating
mathematical, blueprint-status or runtime authority to the cheaper model.
**Outcome:** Focused tests pass; canonical CI/review/deployment remain pending.
The shared owner episode began about 13:40Z, with a 15:40Z/1000-line boundary;
the author's 14:06:27Z start is a subphase, not a budget reset.

## 2026-09-07 - Owner supersedes cleanup-only routing (#301)

**Trigger:** Owner scope comment5573256033 and renewed completion priority,
recorded in events.md; preserved f43be38 and audit remain historical evidence.
**Change:** Sol/Ultra becomes the routine/bounded subagent and routine-review
default. Hard/escalated Astra requires a reason. Root identity stays Astra and
validates both the grandfathered Astra child default and the reviewed Sol default.
The latest Space allocation is five total/three descendants/external0, untouched
by this implementation. Native model contexts, true new-dispatch identity and
pre-activation grandfathering evidence remain checked; actual dispatch ratios
report rolling and cumulative counts without filler or delaying hard jobs.
**Expected effect:** Broader routine delegation implements owner policy without
claiming broader capability evidence from the earlier two-case audit.
**Outcome:** Renewed work continues the same approximately 13:40Z episode beyond
its recorded 15:40Z boundary and extension request5572932276, not a fresh two-hour
allocation. Old 597 tests cover the narrow draft only; revised tests and exact-head
CI/control-policy review/publication gates are recorded separately. No activation yet.
## 2026-09-08 - Exclude allowlisted default-home app-server use (#345)

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md` 2026-09-08, "Owner-approved default-home
app-server occupancy correction", and the owner worker-occupancy receipt dated
September 8, 2026.

**Change:** `account_router.py` extends the existing owner-designated CWD exclusion
only to an exact `app-server` command on the known primary default home. Tests cover
global options, prompt boundaries, generic worker commands, scoped and secondary homes,
unlisted CWDs, reservations, native leases and unavailable host visibility. Current
normative allocation text now defines total `k` as one main plus `k - 1` native workers,
with no unrelated-use reservation and an active-worker floor of
`ceil (0.8 * (k - 1))`.

**Expected effect:** the unrelated VS Code application server no longer consumes a
native worker slot after normal merge and deployment. At Space `k = 10`, meta can bind
the reviewed nine-descendant lease while requiring eight actual active native workers;
main, other processes and configured capacity do not satisfy the activity floor. All
credential, visibility, reservation, lease, review and merge guards remain unchanged.

## 2026-09-08 - Blueprint PDF exit and freshness are blocking (#352)

**Trigger:** `events.md`, "PR #350 blueprint PDF false success", records a
fatal undefined command whose nonzero PDF exit was hidden by a stale artifact
and later successful renderer commands.

**Change:** `ci.sh` removes the prior `print.pdf` and runs the checked-in
`latexmk` configuration directly with noninteractive halt-on-error behavior.
It stops `blueprint-render` on any compiler failure or missing fresh non-empty
output. This bypasses the observed wrapper-success/inner-exit-12 boundary.
Isolated fake-tool tests also cover a fresh partial PDF from that boundary.

**Expected effect:** fatal TeX errors remain blocking exact-head evidence even
when a worktree contains an older PDF or the failed compiler leaves a fresh
partial one, while a successful fresh render keeps the existing bbl, web,
manifest, and publication behavior.

## 2026-09-08 - Resume completed native code-review publication (#366)

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md` entries "Native review publisher
recovery for PRs #320 and #355" and "PR #358 review-format recovery" record
valid native responses stranded after their original `review.sh` publishers
terminated. **Change:** `review.sh --resume-native-request` consumes one existing
single-code-lane request through a new guarded `native_review.py accept` command,
then reuses the normal parser, combiner, final-head check and idempotent publisher.
The continuation rechecks the live root, complete author exclusions, model/Ultra
policy, prompt digest, CI, clean exact head, lock and prior publication evidence;
it creates no request or model turn and rejects prose combinations. **Expected
effect:** a late native response can reach the canonical review record without
manual body reconstruction or a duplicate reviewer, while every existing review
and merge gate remains authoritative. **Outcome:** focused offline regression and
normal CI/independent review are required before deployment.

## 2026-09-08 - Activate prepared successors before receipt adoption (#418)

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md`, "Completion handoff ordering and
source-deadline correction"; the owner-directed regular lifecycle audit found
only 26 of 65 valid sampled minutes at or above eight useful native workers,
including gaps of approximately 10.5 minutes and more than six minutes.

**Change:** `sessions.md`, `useful-queue.md`, `main.md`, `DESIGN.md`, and the
integration-checkpoint wording in `issues-prs.md` now record the active Space
total of ten sessions, native target nine and floor eight, with external admission
zero. Main and the capable coordinator validate useful, disjoint primary and alternate
successor records while slots are occupied and record `ready_at`. Operational readiness
requires current heads or source snapshots, actually published inputs, eligible roles,
current unique operation ownership, complete hash-bound dispatch bodies and deadline rules,
and a separately
validated alternate or an exact no-alternate blocker; descriptive input strings or a
nominal successor line do not qualify. On real completion they perform
only the remaining capacity, identity, ownership, intent, and deadline checks before
the actual native follow-up or spawn call; detailed predecessor receipt and rollout
adoption follows successor start verification. Each activation payload carries an
absolute source deadline no later than its native call plus the authorized limit,
and continuations retain earlier deadlines, so silence before first progress remains
charged. Coordinator-owned latency evidence records the
predecessor terminal event, `ready_at`, activation call, current successor turn,
first useful output, source deadline, and real blockers. The historical one-shot
executor is explicitly not the native controller and receives no code change.

**Expected effect:** ready work occupies a released native slot before forensic
adoption consumes the vacancy, without weakening source, budget, ownership,
review, model, or capacity gates. Backlog recovery and closing snapshots cannot
be reported as prompt or sustained coverage. **Outcome:** the pre-merge
coordinator batch records two missed transitions at 294.078 and 354.659 seconds
from predecessor completion to actual successor start; both have no `ready_at`,
and the latter was not fully prevalidated before completion. Its later count of
nine occupied slots is recovery, not acceptance. Canonical CI, independent hard
control-policy review, and normal merge remain required. Runtime acceptance then
requires a natural post-merge completion transition in the coordinator-owned
batch with the prescribed ordering; sustained coverage remains a separate
interval observation.

## 2026-09-08 - Preseal ordinary successor activation messages (#471)

**Trigger:** the owner decision recorded in issue #471 and the read-only proposal
`/tmp/qpbt-ordinary-successor-prevalidation-20260909.json` with SHA-256
`c93a44f1d711444d0428e391c2abd40ca2a8f3617c4a6126f521afa32ead727e`.
Two selected handoffs took 63.076 and 73.171 seconds, including 27.727 and
29.391 seconds between notification and the native call while long ordinary
arguments were partly regenerated. Coverage remains 66.95% of 119.63 valid
minutes; earlier 116.521- and 134.213-second misses remain failures.

**Change:** `sessions.md`, `useful-queue.md`, and the #471 brief permit only
ordinary proof and CI-handoff records to bind an immutable full-contract path
and SHA-256 plus an exact short activation message sealed before predecessor
completion. Activator and actor both verify the hash and current prerequisites;
the actor reads the full contract before mutation. The budget remains anchored
to actual native `task_started`, bounded by the presealed absolute and inherited
deadlines. Existing full messages remain valid. Canonical review assignments
retain literal nonce/head/prompt-digest/root bindings and consumer holds.

**Expected effect:** ordinary activation can avoid regenerating long arguments
after completion without weakening scope, ownership, model, capacity, budget,
review, CI, merge, or telemetry guards. **Outcome:** pending exact-head CI,
independent hard control-policy review, normal merge, and a later runtime
observation; documentation alone does not establish improved pool coverage.

## 2026-09-09 - Resume completed combined native reviews

**Trigger:** owner assignment of the actual PR #400 consumer recovery, tracked
in issue #475. The publisher terminated with two genuinely completed responses;
the existing continuation rejected its blueprint diff before consumption.
The primary coordinator retains the incident and prior costs in telemetry.

**Change:** `review.sh` accepts an explicit completed prose request alongside
the code request when the diff requires both lanes. Both trust envelopes are
validated through `native_review.py`; the existing parser, combiner, CI, lock,
head and publication guards remain authoritative. Resume scratch files are
separate from canonical prompts and outputs, and independently rebuilt prompts
must match the exact bound digest. Invalid combined evidence publishes nothing.

**Expected effect:** a dead combined publisher can complete without launching
another review or weakening the author/reviewer hold. Activation requires normal
CI, independent hard control-policy review and merge. The PR #400 source repair
and held reviewers remain frozen until canonical consumption succeeds.

**Outcome:** PR #476 passed one canonical exact-head CI run in 249 seconds with
all nine contexts green, and independent hard review `5147206622` approved the
control path with no findings. The service gate merged it as
`81148545f0752ec09b3efe88332b49bb771312be`. The primary used a finite
same-inode telemetry boundary rather than waiting for unrelated writers. The
merged continuation then consumed the preserved PR #400 CODE and PROSE
responses and published canonical failure review `5147250926` with seven
unresolved findings. It launched no new model turn, edited no response or
source, and released the old reviewer and source holds. PR #400 remains
ineligible to merge until its isolated repair proceeds through normal checked
publication, CI, and fresh independent review.

## 2026-09-09 - Move the permissions-only owner inbox to #500

**Trigger:** the owner's 2026-09-09 08:40Z design decision, recorded by pinned
issue #500 and implemented through issue #501.

**Change:** `AGENTS.md`, `local/DESIGN.md`, the main, orchestrator, and mathfix
personas, the issue/PR and session protocols, the pre-commit guidance, and the
paper-gap policy and register now route live owner-inbox traffic to #500. The
inbox accepts only permissions whose risk extends beyond project development;
main decides and records project-outcome questions, including workflow-budget
overrides and consecutive workflow-only episodes. Changing the stated project
goal stays outside main's authority and needs an owner decision on #500. The
budget guard remains enforced. Each blocker is one comment with at most ten
visible plain-language lines, lettered options, one recommendation, and the
literal `DECISION B<n>: <letter>` reply, where the letter is an offered
alternative. Ids continue after B11 and details are folded. The immutable
`<!-- owner-inbox id=B<n> -->` marker keys both creation and resolution through
`ensure-pr-comment`; a separate body field records open or closed status, and a
resolved blocker adds `RESOLVED B<n>`. Issue #26 is archived. Existing #26
citations in this ledger and the QPBT gap register remain unchanged or are
explicitly marked as historical provenance.

**Expected effect:** owner attention is reserved for actions requiring personal
permission, while routine status, mathematical difficulty, and project-outcome
decisions continue without avoidable stalls and with concise decision requests.

## 2026-09-09 - Reviewed merge trains (issue #502)

**Trigger:** the 09:05Z meta decision in `results/telemetry/design-decisions.md`
(D1, issue #502) records that each single-PR merge invalidates other refreshed
heads. See the issue #502 development entry in `results/telemetry/events.md`.

**Change:** add `pr_train.py`, a non-publishing integration mode in `ci.sh`,
and a train-manifest check after `checked-push.sh` preflight. Reuse the existing
member gates and CI steps; replace only individual-head base ancestry with
mandatory combined-commit validation. Preserve exact-head independent review,
dependency gates, checked fast-forward publication, and the full-build lock.
CI step bodies stop on command failure; cache warming cannot start a nested
full build. `issues-prs.md` documents the operator-owned invocation and recovery.

**Expected effect:** two or more ready PRs share one integration build and CI
run without losing a member's evidence or silently discarding accepted work.
Activation remains subject to independent review and daemon-owner deployment.

## 2026-09-09 - PR507 review repair: build coverage and publication outcomes

**Trigger:** Canonical review `5154118210` on `e1dd7bb0`, findings F1-F3;
see the issue #502 review-repair entry in `results/telemetry/events.md`.
**Change:** Combined CI builds the full library and axiom audit in one locked
invocation. Train names satisfy the external Lake-root validator. Ambiguous
pushes retain unknown outcomes when reconciliation fails and recognize remote
descendants containing the train. Outcomes are retained in runtime and telemetry.
**Expected effect:** Cold publication has its root artifact, untouched downstream
failures block publication, and operators receive no false refusal after an
unresolved push. This is the authorized bounded repair of the original episode;
deployment and independent review remain separate.

## 2026-09-09 - Simplify dispatcher worker reservations (#505)

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md`, 2026-09-09T11:22Z stale-HOLD incident
and the issue #505 implementation entry for `orc-505-20260909-01`.
**Change:** `sessions.md` and `DESIGN.md` define marker-only reservations using
the two worker caps, missing as zero, ratio selection and 10-second polling.
The router and shim drop retired gates; native lease and queue entrypoints are
retired, and `useful-queue.md` becomes historical. Resume/model affinity,
telemetry, fan-out restrictions and publication/review gates remain enforced.
**Expected effect:** free configured worker slots are usable without the retired
Space admission machinery. Installed qpbt-switch retirement belongs to the meta
session; this branch changes neither that command nor live caps. Runtime effect
is unverified until checked publication, independent review and deployment.

## 2026-09-09 - Complete native review retirement (#505)

**Trigger:** PR #508 review F1 found that a stale
`MIPSTARRE_NATIVE_REVIEW_ROOT` export still diverted `review.sh` into the
disabled lease-backed handler, while active operator prose still required the
retired native pool. This is the review-facing remainder of the
`results/telemetry/events.md` 2026-09-09T11:22Z stale-HOLD incident.
**Change:** `review.sh` sends every new review through external `dispatch.sh`
and clears inherited native-review variables after warning. `review.md`, the
main persona, and active workflow summaries now direct new work through marker-
reserved external dispatch; the former native review procedure remains marked
as historical. **Expected effect:** stale shell configuration cannot strand a
review in the retired lease verifier, and operators no longer receive mutually
exclusive native-lease and external-capacity instructions.

## 2026-09-09 - Tolerate telemetry-only base movement at merge (#498)

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md`, "2026-09-09 — Meta intervention:
stalled \"Space\" main session replaced; detached-worker architecture
reinstated", and the later same-day approved-refresh entries. Telemetry snapshot
commits moved `main` while exact-head CI and review lanes were completing, so
otherwise ready pull requests became stale without a source or blueprint change.
Owner comment `5599043067` at `2026-09-09T08:45:54Z` delegated the B9 decision
to main; main authorized option B with the conservative data-and-mode scope
recorded below.

**Change:** `pr_merge.py` gate 2b and its daemon-facing freshness helper retain
base ancestry as the fast path. When ancestry fails, they parse NUL-delimited
raw Git changes with rename detection disabled and accept only regular
non-executable `.md`/`.jsonl` files below `results/telemetry/` and generated
regular non-executable `.json` files below the exact
`results/telemetry/github-snapshot/` subtree. Python, shell, JavaScript and other
code; executable modes and mode changes; symlinks; unknown or boundary paths;
and all nontelemetry paths remain freshness-relevant. Additions, deletions and
renames are checked by path and tree mode. Missing merge bases, malformed raw
records and failed Git commands still refuse. `issues-prs.md` records the rule,
and `review.md` limits review carry-forward to refreshes still required by it.

**Scope disposition:** PR #499 review F2 names the retired Space merge service.
Main disposition is out of scope: this repair does not revive, edit or restart
that service. The active v9f daemon must consume the accepted
`pr_merge.head_is_fresh` predicate in a separately checked rollout after this
change merges; no running daemon or rollout script is changed here.

**Expected effect:** telemetry publication no longer serializes all otherwise
mergeable pull requests behind another refresh lane, while executable telemetry
tools and unrecognized data remain protected. Any Lean, blueprint, code, mode,
symlink, unknown-path or other non-allowlisted base change still requires
refresh, exact-head CI and independent review; all other merge gates are
unchanged.

## 2026-09-12 - Reconcile the app-server fix with router retirement (#350)

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md`, September 12, 2026, "PR #350 merge
conflicts after router retirement", and the requested merge of `github/main`.
**Change:** retain main's issue #505 marker-only account router and current
protocols while preserving the issue #345 brief, incident and amendment as history.
The legacy CWD-exclusion setting is covered by the retired-settings regression.
**Expected effect:** an unmarked application server consumes no worker reservation;
merging the older fix does not restore host scans, native leases or retired gates.
This reconciliation changes no Lean declarations, live allocation or credentials.

## 2026-09-12 - Reconcile owner inbox and dispatcher retirement in PR #503

**Trigger:** the user's merge-resolution request for PR #503 in session
`orc-pr503-20260912-01`, merging `github/main` at `ae124f8f` into
`issue-501-owner-inbox-500`.

**Change:** reconcile `AGENTS.md` and `issues-prs.md` so the permissions-only
owner inbox remains #500 and mathematical-gap work uses external dispatch,
consistent with #505's retirement of native descendants. Retain both branches'
existing entries in this ledger.

**Expected effect:** the merged instructions preserve #501's owner-permission
boundary and #505's dispatcher retirement without reviving either archived path.

## 2026-09-09 - PR507 bounded refresh composition

**Trigger:** main's priority recovery instruction for issue #502; see the
`orc-502-20260909-03` entry in `results/telemetry/events.md`.
**Change:** preserve the train's exact frozen-base condition while composing
the reviewed ordinary-PR telemetry freshness predicate and PR506's step-failure
explanation. No allowlist, member gate, publication, or cleanup rule changes.
**Expected effect:** ordinary telemetry movement remains tolerated; any train
base movement still refuses. Independent verification follows genuine green CI.

## 2026-09-12 - Reconcile PR260 standing guidance with current main

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md`, "2026-09-12 - PR260 standing
policy merge recovery", and the requested merge of `ae124f8f` into PR #260.

**Change:** reconcile the main persona and issues/PR protocol with main's
Sol/Astra Ultra selection, configured account caps and retired native queue,
while retaining autonomous useful-work reassessment, the explicit B7/B8 return
to main and cumulative budget records. The orchestrator's mathfix instruction
uses current Ultra effort. Review carry-forward keeps main's narrow passive
telemetry freshness exception and the PR's existing review-cap restriction.
The shim uses main's single attached-model parser; the PR's normalization tests
remain, with current model/effort expectations. Historical event paragraphs
lost by the automatic merge are appended verbatim.

**Expected effect:** refreshing this older policy branch preserves its useful
duties and evidence without reinstating superseded runtime admission rules,
losing model-option coverage, or weakening proof, review or merge gates.

## 2026-09-14 - Merge subjects carry the PR's Lean line delta (#557)

**Trigger:** owner decision recorded in issue #557: GitHub's commits page showed
`Merge pull request #N from Dengnifer/issue-...` and nothing about the size of
the packet, so reading how much Lean a merge brought meant opening it.

**Change:** `issues-prs.md` records the merge subject
`Merge PR #N: <PR title> [lean +A -D]`, measured past the gates from
`git diff --numstat <merge base>...<head> -- '*.lean'`, with `[lean 0]` for a PR
that changes no Lean line and a one-line body naming the frozen head SHA.
`pr_merge.py` computes it and `gh_common.merge_pr` forwards it through the REST
`commit_title` / `commit_message` keys, which stay out of the payload entirely
when absent. The count is cosmetic by contract: measured after every gate, never
read back as evidence, and absent rather than wrong when git cannot answer — the
merge then keeps GitHub's own wording instead of failing. Following PR #558
review finding F1, closing keywords in the untrusted PR title are defused
(`closes #900` becomes `closes issue 900`) before they reach the subject, and a
subject that would still read as a closing reference is dropped in favour of
GitHub's wording.

**Expected effect:** the owner reads each merged packet's approximate Lean size
off the commits page without opening the merge, no pull request that cleared the
seven gates can fail on a cosmetic number, and gate 7's dependency check keeps
covering every closing reference that reaches the default branch.

## 2026-09-17 - PR507 review repair: member-ref leases and canonical telemetry

**Trigger:** canonical review `5194195608` on `26ecf158`, findings F1 (blocker)
and F2; see the issue #502 review-repair entries in
`results/telemetry/events.md`.

**Change:** the train publication transport is now atomic and leases every
verified member ref at its verified value alongside the `main` lease, so a
member branch that moves between verification and transport makes the remote
refuse the entire push; verification returns the refs it confirmed instead of
only reading them, and no member branch can be rewound because each is pushed
back at the value it is expected to hold. Train telemetry is written through the
canonical `telemetry.py` writers (`events-md` lock and dated section for
`events.md`, the per-file lock for `builds.jsonl`) rather than a private lock
and a raw append; an unreadable build spool is kept for the operator instead of
being dropped. No gate, member evidence, or publication outcome rule changes.

**Expected effect:** publication cannot carry a member head that stopped being
the member branch's tip at transport start, and a concurrent canonical event
writer can no longer lose or truncate the train's own event.

## 2026-09-17 - Model-free duplicate-work guards before dispatch (#576)

**Trigger:** owner observation recorded in issue #576: quota was spent twice on
the same mathematics. Several open PRs (212, 296, 398, 488, 539, and per the
Opus reviews 289 and 274) prove or declare results `main` already contains,
because tasks covering the same statements were dispatched weeks apart and the
overlap surfaced only at review or merge. On the same day a helper and the main
session repaired PR 577 simultaneously.

**Change:** `local/bin/dup_check.py` searches a ref for a declaration by exact
fully qualified name, by last name component inside the `MIPStarRE` namespace,
and by statement after a cheap normalisation, over explicit names, a blueprint
node's `\lean{}` names, or the declarations a branch or open PR adds against
its merge base; its `sweep` mode reports the same over every open PR as an
`audits/` document. `local/registry/declaration-claims.jsonl` binds declaration
names to the issue producing them, checked at issue creation and at dispatch.
`dispatch.sh` runs the check for the `prover`, `mathfix` and `simplifier` roles
as a warning (`MIPSTARRE_DUP_CHECK=fatal` refuses, `=off` skips).
`local/bin/claim.sh` brings the meta session's atomic worker-claim list into the
repository, format unchanged, with the file location overridable so it can be
tested. `scripts/blueprint_lean_sync.collect_file_lean_decls` gained an optional
`text=` argument so a ref can be parsed without a checkout; its behaviour is
unchanged when the argument is absent. `issues-prs.md` section 7 records the
obligations. No tool calls a model, and only the sweep's list of open PRs
touches the network.

**Expected effect:** an overlap is visible before a prover run pays for it, the
main session can close or shrink a superseded PR instead of repairing it, and
two workers no longer repair the same PR at once. The guards are advisory by
construction: a text match is a prompt to look, never a verdict about the
mathematics, and no gate is weakened by them.

## 2026-09-17 - The merge subject's Lean delta counts code lines only (#574)

**Trigger:** owner request recorded in issue #574: the `[lean +A -D]` bracket
added by issue #557 counted every changed line of every `*.lean` file, so a
docstring sweep or a commented-out block read on the commits page like a large
code change and the figure stopped answering the question it was added for.

**Change:** `issues-prs.md` records that A and D count changed Lean **code**
lines. `pr_merge.lean_line_delta` now takes the changed blobs from
`git diff --raw -z --find-renames` (blob ids, so renames need no path handling),
reads the added line numbers from the head blob's `-U0` hunk headers and the
removed ones from the merge-base blob's, and counts a line only when a
single-pass scanner calls it code. That scanner tracks nesting block comments —
`/-`, and the `/--` and `/-!` forms that share its `-/` closer — skips line
comments, blank and whitespace-only lines, and keeps a line whose code is merely
trailed by a comment. It is naive by design about the rest of Lean's grammar:
only double-quoted strings hide delimiters, and string and escape state carry
across physical lines until the closing quote. Added and deleted files count
their own code lines; a pure rename counts none.

**Scope disposition:** the cosmetic-by-contract rule of issue #557 is unchanged
and now explicit in the code: the measurement is wrapped so that it returns
`None` on any failure and cannot raise, the subject format stays
`[lean +A -D]` with `[lean 0]` for a PR that changes no Lean code line, and no
gate, CI step or REST payload key changes.

**Expected effect:** the bracket tracks the Lean code a packet actually moved,
documentation-only and comment-only work reads as such on the commits page, and
no pull request that cleared the seven gates can fail on the number.

## 2026-09-18 - PR507: the train's publication contract, claims and post-push check

**Trigger:** the 2026-09-17 independent adjudication of PR #507
(`/tmp/pr507-publication-adjudication-20260917-report.md`, archived under
`native-audits/pr507-publication-adjudication-01a0afd6/`) reproduced, against a
real `receive-pack`, a member ref advancing after the ref advertisement and
before the remote committed `main`, with the transport still reporting success.
Finding F1 of review `5194195608` therefore stayed open: the member leases added
on 2026-09-17 are client-side comparisons against the advertisement, and a member
that still matches sends no update command, so the transaction holds no
server-side predicate for it. The owner authorized a narrower contract on
2026-09-18 rather than leaving the reviewed train unusable.

**Change:** `issues-prs.md` now states the contract in four parts instead of
implying an atomic guard over every member: main only ever advances to an
integration of the exact reviewed member SHAs; server-side atomicity covers the
refs the transaction carries; the advertisement-to-commit window for an unmoved
member is an accepted residual; and two mechanisms bound it. First, `pr_train.py`
claims every member on the shared atomic claim list (`local/bin/claim.sh` when
the checkout has it, otherwise the meta session's `qpbt-claim.sh`) with kind
`train` and party `main` before the first gate reads a member, refuses to start
and prints the holder line when another writer holds one, and releases the claims
after the transport and its re-verification end — on success, on failure and on
every abort path. Second, immediately after a successful transport the train
re-reads every member ref from the remote; a member that moved is recorded as a
CONTRACT VIOLATION on stdout, in `publication.json` and in the train event with
the verified SHA, the observed SHA and any claim-list holder line, its train
comment is not posted, and the run exits non-zero. The overclaiming wording in
`pr_train.py`, `checked-push.sh` and the protocol is corrected to say what Git
actually compares and when. No gate, member evidence, publication outcome rule,
or `pr_merge.py` behaviour changes, and the train remains undeployed.

**Expected effect:** the documented guarantee matches the mechanism; the only
writers that could exercise the residual window are held off it by a claim they
must take anyway; and a violation by anything else is detected, recorded and
visible in the exit status instead of passing as a clean publication.

## 2026-09-18 - Lean-delta subjects for train members (#590)

**Trigger:** The owner requires a Lean delta in every first-parent merge subject
on main (issue #590); the reviewed train still used bare member subjects even
though ordinary merges already followed the policy from issues #557 and #574.

**Change:** `pr_train.py` uses `pr_merge.lean_line_delta` on each committed merge
against its immediately preceding accepted train commit, then applies
`pr_merge.merge_commit_title` with the gated member title. Zero deltas retain
`[lean 0]`; an unavailable count or unusable title retains the train's existing
subject without blocking integration. Gated titles remain transient, so member
manifests and publication checks are unchanged.

**Expected effect:** each merge commit published by a reviewed train carries
the same approximate Lean code-line signal as an ordinary merge, with no
cumulative count or spurious deletion of newer main-only content.

## 2026-09-18 - Schedule reviewed trains in the model-free daemon (#593)

**Trigger:** Owner issue #593 and the 2026-09-18 daemon scan: the merged train
and member-title policy had no caller in `/tmp/merge-daemon-v9k-cpa.sh`, leaving
approved stale heads idle at PAR=0.

**Change:** `issues-prs.md` records daemon admission, telemetry preparation,
primary quiet-window coordination and refusal handling. `daemon_train.py`
routes one pinned clean/stale batch and delegates all publication gates to the
existing `pr_train.py`. The reviewed runtime patch and deployment instructions
are under `local/deploy/`; no running daemon is changed by this commit.

**Expected effect:** after independent review and controlled deployment, one
daemon process can submit a reviewed batch without replacing its ordinary
single-PR path, overlapping telemetry commits, or silently losing a local
telemetry lead. A refused or uncertain train remains held for reconciliation.

## 2026-09-18 - Preserve approved train pins and inspect unpublished history (#595)

**Trigger:** Independent review 5244965776 at `00e2079f` found that a green
replacement head could pass the train after the adapter had scanned the
operator's pinned head, and that changed-then-reverted nontelemetry commits
could pass the adapter's net-tree test (see the PR595 entry in
`results/telemetry/events.md`).

**Change:** The daemon passes approved PR-to-SHA pins to the train. Under the
existing member claims, gate results must match the requested pins; the train
manifest retains those pins for the publication verifier, including members
dropped for conflicts. Standalone number-only trains remain available. During
daemon preparation, every unpublished commit must satisfy the existing passive
telemetry path-and-mode policy before `github-sync.sh main` runs. The accepted
claim, lease, atomic transport and post-push verification contract is unchanged.

**Expected effect:** A later independently approved but unrequested head never
enters the batch, and reversed nontelemetry local history stays available for
operator reconciliation rather than being published by the adapter.

## 2026-09-17 - Record independent mixed-model review (#575; interim rule)

**Trigger:** owner 11:22Z decision and explicit resend allocating six Mac
helper slots as three fixers/three reviewers; same-day correction withdrawing
Opus review of Opus-modified PRs. See `results/telemetry/events.md`,
"2026-09-17 META 11:22Z owner decisions", "Read new owner11:22Z OPUS
REVIEWERS handoff and same-day correction", and "2026-09-17 META 11:37Z";
issue #575 records the requested durable amendment.

**Change (superseded by the 12:29Z ruling below):** The interim assignment rule
restricted Opus reviewers to PRs not modified by Opus helpers and assigned
Opus-changed PRs to independent native Codex review. The owner-run exception to
dispatch-only review remains: the three Mac reviewers publish marked
exact-head COMMENT evidence; MAIN checks the published record and owns the
summary status. Existing claims, trusted-source, CI, caps, round limits,
source-faithfulness and strict-diff carry remain binding. This changes no
scripts, keys, allocation, project goal, or merge authority: provenance and
handback validation are documented operator duties, not new code enforcement.

**Expected effect (interim):** separate reviewer capacity could shorten the
review queue without same-model approval of Opus repairs or treating stale,
malformed, or unpublished reviews as merge evidence. Existing automated
exact-head gates continue to enforce their prior conditions; no throughput
gain was asserted before observation.

## 2026-09-17 - Replace family exclusion with session independence (#575)

**Trigger:** the owner's 12:29Z ruling in the OPUS REVIEWERS handoff in
`/tmp/qpbt-main-handoff-v5.md`: "a new Opus session counts for independent".
This explicitly supersedes the earlier same-day meta correction recorded above.

**Change:** `review.md` now permits a fresh Opus reviewer session to review
any PR, including one repaired or refreshed by a different Opus session, so
long as the reviewer has never worked on that PR. This matches native Codex
session independence; same-model provenance is not grounds for rejection.
Cross-model review is preferred only when it costs nothing. The six Mac slots
(three fixers, three reviewers), relay-1 MAIN with one native delegate, and
0/0/0 external caps remain unchanged. No goal, gate, key, runtime or merge
authority changes; MAIN's provenance and evidence checks remain operator duties.

**Expected effect:** independently reviewed Opus-modified PRs can use open
reviewer slots without weakening trusted prompts, full-diff read-only review,
exact-head COMMENT evidence, MAIN's fail-closed status check, round caps, or
the whitespace-sensitive carry rule. No throughput gain is asserted before
observation.

## 2026-09-19 - Definition of done and a model-free completion gate (#635)

**Trigger:** the owner's policy decision of 2026-09-19 in the meta session,
*"some protocol(s) in the workflow should ensure that when the project
finishes, the formalization is done without caveat, and satisfies the lean
comparator"*, and, earlier the same day, *"i want zero sorry"*. Context:
`results/telemetry/events.md`, "2026-09-18T16:44Z - META TAKEOVER (owner
instruction)" and the 2026-09-19T12:49:41Z bullet added with this change.

**Change:** new protocol `local/protocols/completion.md` ("definition of
done"), naming the seven criteria a formalization track must satisfy before it
may be declared finished — zero proof debt under the track's Lean root, a
built axiom audit over the track's headline theorems, a terminal status on
every paper-gap row, every `\lean{}` blueprint node marked or exempted with a
reason, a recorded and drift-checked comparator challenge whose verified
library commit is an ancestor-or-equal of the commit being declared and whose
registered expected copy names every headline theorem, truthful status docs,
and the files an ITP artifact submission needs (C7: the registered artifact
files and `scripts/make_artifact.sh`, whose snapshot leak scan is delegated).
The coverage half of C5 is decided against the challenge file, not against the
hand-written `covered-theorems` row of the same document, so no criterion
validates a document against itself. C2 accepts either audit command the
repository defines, `assert_standard_axioms` (LDT) or `audit_standard_axioms`
(the QPBT audit module merged from main on 2026-09-19), rather than making one
tree rename its command to satisfy the gate. New model-free checker
`scripts/completion_gate.py`
(`check --track qpbt`) with unit tests under `scripts/tests/`; it loads the
sorry-site rule out of `results/telemetry/owner-tools/estimate.sh` and imports
`DECL_RE`/`strip_lean_comments` from `scripts/audit_lean_axiom_declarations.py`
rather than restating either rule. Pointers added in `local/personas/main.md`
and `local/README.md` (`AGENTS.md` is at 730 lines, past the ~700-line
session-start budget of `CLAUDE.md`, so the pointer went to `local/README.md`).
The protocol also records where the comparator challenge lives: a separate
repository outside this one and outside the umbrella repository, as
`LDT-comparator` already is; creating it is an owner action.

**Expected effect:** "done" stops being a judgement call. The main session may
not post a completion statement on issues 27/168, close a track's umbrella
issues or tag a release unless the gate exits 0 on that exact commit with its
output attached, and a failing gate is main's to-do list rather than an owner
blocker. The gate is deliberately kept out of the blocking PR CI — `ci.sh` has
no non-blocking step class and the gate must fail until the comparator
challenge exists — so CI is unchanged by this entry. First run on
`c6c8c2f2`: C1 and C6 pass (the QPBT tree is already free of sorry sites),
C2–C5 fail, which is the remaining work list; C7 was added in the same PR and
fails too, naming the artifact files that do not exist yet.

## 2026-09-19 - CI builds the QPBT axiom audit (#640)

**Trigger:** the owner's 2026-09-19 policy decision that completion means a
caveat-free, comparator-checked formalization, ready to attach as an ARTIFACT to
an ITP submission. The ITP-readiness audit of the same day found that the
QPBT axiom-cleanliness claim was not reproducible inside the repository: the
Lean tree held zero `#print axioms` directives, the only audit module
(`MIPStarRE/LDT/Test/AxiomAudit.lean`) covered the classical low-degree track
only, and the "three standard axioms" result came from a one-off metaprogram in
a worktree that was then discarded. Issue #640 records the gap.

**Change:** `MIPStarRE/QPBT/Test/AxiomAudit.lean` audits the QPBT headline
declarations — `pauli_soundness`, `pauli_soundness_qubit`, `exists_ld_soundness`,
the completeness pair, the four combining results, the three extraction results,
and the two corrected forms `exists_extendedLinesWitness_established` and
`exists_symmetric_projective_strategy_approx`. Its `audit_standard_axioms`
command calls `Lean.collectAxioms`, logs the axiom set, and throws unless that
set is exactly `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`, naming `sorryAx`
explicitly when it is the offender. The build step of `ci.sh` and the
corresponding step of `.github/workflows/pr-ci.yml` now build
`MIPStarRE.LDT.Test.AxiomAudit MIPStarRE.QPBT.Test.AxiomAudit` instead of the
LDT target alone, in both the per-PR and the `--integration-head` invocations;
`ci.md` §2, §7 and §7's train paragraph are updated in lockstep, as amendments
§12 requires. No gating glob, manifest field, status context, lock or schema
changes, so no consumer of the manifest is affected; the QPBT audit is reached
by the existing `lean` filter, which already matches `**.lean`.

Following the LDT precedent, the module is a CI build target and is *not*
imported from the `MIPStarRE.QPBT` umbrella, so the audits stay out of normal
downstream imports while still acting as regression tests. This is a
re-automation, the opposite direction from §8's deliberate de-automation of
`blueprint_leanok_axioms.py`: that check needs a full Lean environment the
`blueprint-sync` job does not have, whereas these audits ride the build the
`build` step already pays for, at the cost of elaborating one extra module whose
imports the step compiled anyway.

**Expected effect:** an axiom regression in a QPBT headline theorem — a `sorry`
left open, a new `axiom` declaration, a `native_decide` route — now fails the
`build` step instead of passing unnoticed until someone re-runs a metaprogram by
hand, and the build log carries the printed axiom sets as the positive record a
reviewer of the artifact can re-derive. No throughput or timing gain is
asserted before observation; the added elaboration is one module against a full
library build.

## 2026-09-21 - Register the real split QPBT comparator tree (#662)

**Trigger:** the owner's four-target publication requirement for issue #662 and
PR #663, recorded in the 2026-09-21T11:14:09Z event, together with
`results/telemetry/comparator-post-recovery-validation-20260921.md`. The latter
found that stale declaration metadata had clipped four modules in the recovered
31-file expected tree, while the completion protocol still described the old
two-target state.

**Change:** `local/protocols/completion.md` now describes the registered QPBT
expected path as the complete split tree. `scripts/completion_gate.py` retains
the exact expected-copy agreement, all-four-headline coverage, verified-revision
ancestry and delegated comparator requirements. Its focused tests now bind the
registry to `scripts/comparator/challenges/qpbt.json`, require split generation,
derive coverage from the four registered headline targets, and inspect the real
generated tree rather than accepting a hand-written coverage list.

**Expected effect:** C5 cannot silently regress to a single file or a two-target
challenge. A completion claim still requires the official comparator evidence,
only the three permitted standard axioms, an ancestor-or-equal verified library
revision and a passing drift check on the exact completion commit.

## 2026-09-23 - Permit terminal documentation of intermediate differences

**Trigger:** the owner's 2026-09-22 15:10Z instruction, "document, don't prove",
and main's explicit assignment in `/tmp/main-document-symmetrization-20260922.md`
at `a4782a5acc1627ec7ab76cf67592fdd53bea535c`, recorded in
`results/telemetry/events.md`, "Intermediate documentation disposition for
symmetrization". This supersedes the demand that every intermediate difference
converge to an adopted stronger correction before its documentation can close.

**Change:** `local/protocols/completion.md` admits `documented-deviation` under
C3 for justified intermediate differences with a mathematical gap note, matching
blueprint remark and `docs/DEVIATIONS.md` disclosure. The status does not prove
the printed claim or certify an external result in Lean. The checker accepts
the new status, rejects its use for a named registered headline or absent source
cell, and retains rejection of unknown/open/pending/blank states. Focused tests
cover the mixed terminal statuses, headline restriction, invalid statuses and
the unchanged behavior of C1/C2/C4/C5/C6/C7. Independent review still judges the
mathematical justification and supporting artifacts. Existing `corrected` and
`no-difference` meanings and all headline requirements are retained.

**Expected effect:** the symmetrization documentation can close honestly while
its nonempty counterexample remains external mathematics and the affected
answer-reduction and compression rank guarantees remain unresolved. The gate
is not added to blocking PR CI. Only the assigned register row changes status;
historical audits and cumulative cost evidence are preserved. No Lean theorem
or proof changes, and no new proof campaign follows from this disposition.

## 2026-09-23 - Distinguish headline citations from statement changes

**Trigger:** PR #707 operator comment 5780049792 and main's final integration
assignment in `/tmp/main-fix707-c3-integration-20260922.md`, recorded in
`results/telemetry/events.md`, "C3 dimension import citation false positive".
The real dimension row names the `lem:ld-soundness` import while documenting
an intermediate obstruction, so the new identifier check rejected one of the
owner's assigned documentation closures without identifying a headline change.

**Change:** `local/protocols/completion.md` and `scripts/completion_gate.py`
distinguish a source citation from a mathematical assertion about that source.
C3 retains its terminal vocabulary and nonempty source requirement, and stops
inferring headline scope from identifier occurrence. Independent review must
certify that `documented-deviation` concerns an intermediate difference, with
the required justification and documentation; a changed headline statement or
unproved headline dependency remains inadmissible under that status. All other
completion requirements, including comparator evidence, remain unchanged.
Regression tests use the real dimension source cell, preserve invalid-status
checks and verify that the other six criteria still reject their failing inputs.

**Expected effect:** a truthful import or proof-route citation does not prevent
documentation closure. Static acceptance remains distinct from mathematical
certification. No register row, Lean statement, blueprint marker or historical
cost record changes in this correction.

## 2026-09-22 - Align active repository identity after rename (#705)

**Trigger:** the owner's rename instruction, admitted issue #705 packet, and
the 2026-09-22T14:39Z entry in `results/telemetry/events.md`. GitHub, queried
through the primary `gh_common.py`, resolves both the old library alias and
the former umbrella spelling to `Dengnifer/MIPStarRE-QPBT`.

**Change:** update the current repository identity in `AGENTS.md`,
`local/DESIGN.md`, `local/protocols/issues-prs.md`, and `local/personas/main.md`.
The main persona and `local/protocols/completion.md` no longer describe this
same repository as a separate umbrella outside the main session's scope;
external repositories still require explicit owner authorization. Align the
sync fallback, artifact metadata, site configuration, current documentation
links, and test fixtures. Preserve owner-name anonymization for both aliases
and cover the lowercase Pages host. Append this record without rewriting old
protocol history, telemetry, paper mirrors, or accepted comparator evidence.

**Expected effect:** new exports and workflow defaults use the canonical
repository, historical and current identifying URLs remain anonymized, and
the scope instructions distinguish the library from actual external
repositories. No CI, review, merge, completion, or dependency-pin gate changes.

## 2026-09-29 - Keep the bound strength each proof establishes (#732)

**Trigger:** the owner's 2026-09-29 instruction to fix the protocol kit and workflow design so that proofs stop
weakening their bounds, after the error-bound surveys on #727, recorded in `results/telemetry/events.md`, "Protocol
blind spot: bound strength". The QPBT witness exponent is `1/5,242,880,000` where the same proofs support
`1/327,680,000`; the LDT headline loses in the same ways. Every existing rule measured "weakened" against the paper.

**Change:** `AGENTS.md` gains *Bound strength*: state what the proof gives; keep separate errors separate; keep
coefficients out of exponents; no free loss; weakening only as a named `Weakening:` corollary; a stage
ledger per track (QPBT: `docs/bound-ledger-qpbt.md`); explicit-constant siblings of existential headlines;
paper-labelled declarations keep the paper's form with the sharp bound as a separate sibling; interfaces fixed by
skeletons and briefs carry explicit, separate error terms. It also gains an audit-list
bullet, review item 13 and a reuse caveat on item 7. The review prompt that `review.sh` reads gains item 11 and a
caveat on item 7: only a loss the PR introduces, in an exponent or degree on a headline's dependency path and not
recorded as `necessary` or `deferred #N`, is a finding; coefficient-only losses go in the review prose. `review.md` §6 states the same severities. `completion.md` adds
C8 (explicit siblings, the stage ledger with `sharp` / `necessary: <reason>` / `deferred #N` dispositions, one
quantitative survey before the first completion statement), and `scripts/completion_gate.py` checks its static half
with tests. Personas: prover (rule and output section), mathfix (minimality no longer weakens a bound), blueprint
(proof rates for `poly` steps, *Loose bounds* output), splitter, reviewer (A7, S3), simplifier, orchestrator, scout
and main (ledger and survey duty); the prover role line in `dispatch.sh`; minimality in `issues-prs.md` §6.
`docs/anti_patterns.md` A7, `docs/formalization-patterns.md` Pattern 7, `docs/PROOF_INTEGRITY.md`,
`docs/project_conventions.md` and `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` §5. The same amendment is applied to the kit branch `kit/formalize-any-paper`.

**Expected effect:** new and changed estimate lemmas state the bounds their proofs give, lossy restatements become
review findings, and no track is declared finished without its ledger. Losses already in the tree are the ledger's
backlog, not findings against unrelated PRs. No Lean statement or proof changes. C8 fails the QPBT completion gate
until `docs/bound-ledger-qpbt.md` exists with its *Stage ledger*; that is main's to-do list, not an owner blocker.

## 2026-09-30 - Make the C8 ledger format canonical and fail closed (#732)

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md`, "C8 fourth-review disposition: gate
remains blocked" (2026-09-30T00:04:57Z), exposed the general ambiguity caused
by reconstructing Markdown paragraph and Setext context. The owner's relayed
decision in issue #27 comment 5901583288
(`meta-decision-737-c8-fail-closed-20260930`) replaces that repair target with a
strict canonical format for PR #737.

**Change:** C8 now accepts one exact `## Stage ledger` heading, optional blank
lines, and one contiguous outer-piped table with its delimiter and data rows.
Only the next unindented level-two ATX heading with a nonempty title ends the
section; other nonblank constructs fail with a named diagnostic. Optional-pipe
tables, HTML comments, Setext headings, fences, thematic breaks, indented
blocks, subheadings, prose rows and second tables are intentionally rejected.
These conservative rendering rejections are accepted: the static checker is a
canonical-format convenience, while mathematical coverage and honesty remain
delegated to the ledger survey and independent review.

**Review authority:** the owner-relayed meta decision admits exactly one fifth
independent review after the new head is committed and CI-green. If that fifth
review still reports a parsing case, the same decision authorizes an override
merge with the case recorded and C8's delegated ledger inspection covering the
remaining limitation. This entry records authority only; it does not claim that
the review approved or that an override merge occurred. No sixth review or
unrelated override is authorized. Main records the actual outcome.

**Expected effect:** ledger syntax is linear to validate and unambiguous to
write, without maintaining a partial Markdown renderer or weakening C8's
delegated mathematical inspection.

**Outcome:** PR #737 merged normally as `d1d7af164a52a59f200cdc37aadbd25a9417af4e`
after exact-head CI and approving fifth review 5360274290, with zero findings.
The conditional override authorized by comment5901583288 was not used.

## 2026-09-30 — Raise the workflow-layer commit budget to 5000 lines

**Trigger:** owner decision, 2026-09-30, relayed by the Decoy project's meta session ("tell qpbt-autoF to raise the
ceiling to 5000 as well") and confirmed by the owner in the QPBT meta session; the Decoy project's identical guard
moves to 5000 at the same time. Recorded in `results/telemetry/events.md`.

**Change:** `.githooks/pre-commit` refuses a staged workflow-layer change above 5000 lines (was 1000; 400 before
2026-09-05) unless `MIPSTARRE_INFRA_OVERRIDE=1` is set after a recorded main decision. The hook's regression tests
build a 5001-line change, and the budget rule in `local/personas/main.md` says 5000. Everything else about the guard
is unchanged: it still runs before the `MIPSTARRE_SKIP_HOOKS` exit, still measures merges the same way, and the
override is still never self-granted.

**Expected effect:** the guard still stops runaway scaffolding, at five times the old ceiling. The per-episode
discipline in `local/personas/main.md` (stop at the limit, commit what stands, record, rescope) is unchanged, and
review still checks the PR's cumulative workflow diff.

## 2026-10-02 — Compile and audit the compact Palomar challenge (#774)

**Trigger:** the 2026-10-02 PR #775 compact-gate observation in
`results/telemetry/events.md`: default `lake build` did not reach the unimported
Palomar modules, the existing QPBT audit omitted the compact aliases and the
registered selector value, and byte regeneration did not type-check the final
standalone file.

**Change:** `MIPStarRE.QPBT.Test.AxiomAudit` imports the three configured Palomar
modules, checks the four theorem aliases against the exact standard-axiom set,
and checks the actual `fixedFieldModel` value against that same exact set.  The
local build step and frozen `pr-ci.yml` mirror both run Palomar drift, regenerate
to a temporary path, and compile that fresh `Challenge.lean` with the pinned
environment.  Regression tests bind the five roots, the standalone compile, its
blocking failure behavior, and the preserved expected-file hash.

**Expected effect:** ordinary gate execution compiles the complete compact
dependency DAG before extraction, rejects missing or nonstandard Solution axiom
dependencies, and rejects a byte-current generated artifact that no longer
elaborates, without changing the audited Challenge bytes.

## 2026-10-02 — Pin the Palomar toolchain release (#756)

**Trigger:** `results/telemetry/events.md`, 2026-10-02, "Palomar preparation",
records the official Palomar `toolchains.json` requirement for Lean
`v4.35.0-rc2`, the matching Mathlib tag, and the owner-section-9 decision to
perform the in-project upgrade in issue #756.

**Change:** update the current toolchain version in `AGENTS.md` from Lean and
Mathlib `v4.31.0` to `v4.35.0-rc2`. The repository pins, current root and
artifact documentation, Claude-specific version note, and tested module-pattern
note move to the same exact release. This is version documentation for the
authorized dependency upgrade; no proof-integrity rule, CI gate, cache rule, or
formalization policy changes.

**Expected effect:** agents and artifact users see the exact release selected by
the repository, while historical reports and prior comparator-run records keep
their original version provenance.
