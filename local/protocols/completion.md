# Completion protocol — definition of done

Normative. This protocol says when a formalization **track** may be declared
finished, and forbids the declaration until a model-free gate agrees. Amend it
only through `local/protocols/meta.md` (`EVOLUTION.md` entry, cited trigger).

Trigger for its existence, owner, 2026-09-19: *"some protocol(s) in the
workflow should ensure that when the project finishes, the formalization is
done without caveat, and satisfies the lean comparator"*; earlier the same day,
*"i want zero sorry"*.

## 1. Scope

A **track** is a Lean subtree, the blueprint chapters describing it, its
paper-gap register, its axiom-audit file, its blueprint exemption table, its
comparator record and its artifact file set. The per-track data is §6; QPBT is
the only track registered
today, but nothing here is QPBT-specific.

**Declaring finished** means any public statement that the track is complete: a
completion comment on its umbrella issues (27/168 for QPBT), closing those
issues, tagging a release, or a README/status page that says the track is done.

## 2. Finished without caveat

A track is finished without caveat at a commit when all eight criteria hold *at
that commit*.

**C1 — Proof integrity.** Zero term-level `sorry`, `admit`, project `axiom` or
`constant` declaration, `native_decide` / `decide +native`, or
`Lean.trustCompiler` under the track's Lean root. The sorry-site rule is the
one in `results/telemetry/owner-tools/estimate.sh` (`SORRY_SITE_RE`), and there
is exactly **one** implementation of it: `scripts/completion_gate.py` loads that
line from that file and never restates it. Explicit axiom declarations are
found with `DECL_RE` of `scripts/audit_lean_axiom_declarations.py`, imported
rather than copied.

**C2 — Headline axioms.** Every headline theorem of §6 depends only on
`propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`. The check is a committed
`AxiomAudit` Lean file for the track that carries one audit command per
headline theorem — `assert_standard_axioms` (LDT) or `audit_standard_axioms`
(the command QPBT's audit module defines); both print the axiom set and fail
elaboration unless it is exactly those three — and is built in CI. The gate
checks that the file
exists and covers the table; the axiom values themselves come from the build
and are reported as delegated.

**C3 — Paper gaps terminal.** Every data row of the track's paper-gap register
carries a `Terminal status` cell reading exactly `corrected`,
`no-difference` or `documented-deviation`:

- `corrected` — a documented statement correction that **meets the four
  adoption conditions of `local/protocols/issues-prs.md`** — correctness,
  sufficiency, minimality ("the closest sufficient statement to the source,
  with no unnecessary hypothesis or weakened conclusion and no change to the
  source semantics") and Lean convergence — and carries its three artifacts: a
  gap note, a corrected blueprint node citing it, and, where the printed claim
  is not proved, the printed claim preserved as a non-asserted `Prop` (the
  `lem:symmetric-strat` and `lem:qld-4-13` pattern of 2026-09-19). The
  artifacts are evidence that a correction was adopted; they are not a route
  around those conditions, and a row whose correction weakens a conclusion
  cannot receive `corrected` however complete its artifacts are.
- `no-difference` — the formalization and the source statement agree; nothing
  to correct.
- `documented-deviation` — a justified **intermediate** difference is closed
  by honest mathematical documentation, under the owner's 2026-09-22 15:10Z
  instruction, "document, don't prove". Its mathematical gap note, matching
  blueprint remark and `docs/DEVIATIONS.md` disclosure must state the printed
  assertion, the established result, their difference, affected consumers and
  remaining limitations. External mathematical evidence must be distinguished
  from Lean-certified results. Preserve an existing unasserted printed `Prop`
  and any necessary blueprint exemption; never mark the unsupported printed
  claim proved. This status means a documented difference, **not** proof of
  that claim or adoption of the weaker result as `corrected`. Proving the
  printed intermediate assertion, formalizing its external refutation or
  satisfying the stronger correction-adoption conditions is not required to
  close this documentation task.

No row may have an unknown or blank status, or read `open`, `pending` or `sorry`.
No headline theorem statement may be weaker than the source paper except
through a `corrected` row. `documented-deviation` cannot authorize a headline
statement change or an unproved dependency of a headline theorem: in particular,
`pauli_soundness` remains proved at its printed statement. All requirements of
C1, C2, C4, C5, C6, C7 and C8 remain in force.

The gate checks the status vocabulary and requires a nonempty `Source statement`
cell for `documented-deviation`. A citation of a registered headline theorem or
its blueprint label does not by itself identify a change to that assertion: an
intermediate difference may concern its import, application or proof route. For
example, the dimension-divisibility row cites the `lem:ld-soundness` import while
documenting the intermediate seed and dimension obstruction; the registered
headline statement is unchanged. The gate does not infer mathematical scope
from identifier occurrence. Independent review establishes the intermediate
scope, mathematical justification and adequacy of all three documentation
artifacts, just as it establishes the four adoption conditions for `corrected`.
That review must distinguish an intermediate import or proof-route difference
from a changed headline assertion or an unproved headline dependency; the latter
two remain inadmissible under `documented-deviation`. Headline statement
faithfulness and the comparator requirements of C5 remain binding. A passing
status check does not certify those mathematical judgments.

**C4 — Blueprint marked.** Every blueprint node of the track that carries
`\lean{...}` also carries `\leanok`, or appears in the track's exemption table
with a written reason; `scripts/blueprint_leanok_axioms.py --ci` exits 0. A
node is any environment the repository's blueprint parser recognises: the gate
reads that list out of `_TEX_ENV_BEGIN_RE` in `scripts/blueprint_lean_sync.py`
instead of keeping its own, so an `example` or `remark` node with a Lean link
counts exactly as a theorem does. Which nodes are the track's is read off the
tree and not off section 6: besides the chapters registered there, the gate
reads every other `.tex` beside them whose `\lean{...}` names a declaration
under the track's Lean root, and judges those nodes too, so a node of the track
that lives in a chapter shared with another track is in scope whether or not
its chapter is listed. The
exemption table is the only place a permanently unmarked node may live, and a
row there is a caveat that must be defensible in the paper.

**C5 — Lean comparator.** A comparator challenge exists covering every headline
theorem; the in-repository expected challenge is free of regeneration drift
(`scripts/comparator/check_challenge_drift.py` for that track's expected copy
passes in CI); and the track's comparator record (§6, `docs/comparator.md`)
states the challenge repository, the library commit that repository last
verified with the official `leanprover/comparator` (`permitted_axioms` limited
to the three standard axioms, external kernel check enabled where the platform
allows), and the expected-copy path. That verified commit must be an
ancestor-or-equal of the commit being declared finished, with no Lean change to
the statement closure in between — which is exactly what a passing drift check
proves.

The coverage half of C5 is decided against the challenge, never against the
record alone. The record's `expected-challenge` must be exactly the expected
copy §6 registers for the track, and every headline theorem of §6 must occur in
that file or split challenge tree by its fully-qualified name — the name the assembler of
`scripts/comparator/` writes for each declaration of the closure. A record that
lists a headline theorem the registered expected copy never names fails C5:
`covered-theorems` is written by hand in the same document, by the same session
that wants to declare the track finished, so it may not be its own evidence.
That the challenge *elaborates* to the same statements is the drift check and
the comparator run, both delegated to CI.

**C6 — Docs truthful.** No README, status page or estimate may advertise a
nonzero open-site count once C1 holds. Every doc the track registers (§6) must
exist: a registered doc that has been renamed or deleted fails C6 rather than
being skipped, so the criterion can never report a green run over zero docs.

**C7 — Artifact readiness.** "Done" means ready to be attached as an artifact
to an ITP submission (owner, 2026-09-19), so every file such a submission needs
is committed at the declared commit: the files §6 registers for the track —
today `README.md`, `docs/QPBT-theorem-index.md`, `docs/DEVIATIONS.md`,
`docs/ARTIFACT.md` and `LICENSE` — and the snapshot script
`scripts/make_artifact.sh`. The gate checks that each of them exists and fails
closed naming the missing ones; that the script *produces* a snapshot whose
leak scan passes is a run, and is reported as delegated like C2, C4 and C5.
A missing artifact file is main's to-do list, not a caveat that may be carried
into a completion statement.

**C8 — Bound ledger.** Every headline theorem whose constants are existential
has a proved explicit-constant sibling listed in the track's axiom audit, and
the track's bound ledger (§6) has a `Stage ledger` section: a table with one row
per stage lemma on a headline's dependency path, giving the stated bound, the
bound its argument supports once the losses of `AGENTS.md` *Bound strength*
rule 4 are removed, and a `Disposition` of `sharp`, `necessary: <reason>` or
`deferred #N`. Before the first completion statement, one read-only
quantitative survey by a math-capable model checks the ledger against the proofs
(`AGENTS.md`, *Bound strength*). The gate checks the ledger's shape and
dispositions and fails closed on a missing file, heading, column or unknown
disposition. Whether the bounds and dispositions are honest, and whether every
existential headline has its explicit sibling, is delegated to independent
review, so a passing static half prints `DELEGATED`. Trigger,
owner, 2026-09-29: an error-bound survey found a finished track faithful and
sorry-free, yet its final exponent 16 times smaller than its own proofs support.

## 3. Where the comparator challenge lives

The challenge repository lives **outside** this library repository
(`Dengnifer/MIPStarRE-QPBT`): a separate repository of its own, as `LDT-comparator`
already is for `MIPStarRE.LDT.Test.mainFormal` (`docs/comparator.md`). Three
reasons, in order of weight:

1. *Validating Proofs* level 4 requires the statement to be written in a
   trusted environment separate from the proof code. A challenge inside this
   repository would be elaborated in the same environment it is meant to check.
2. The challenge must depend on this library **pinned by commit**. A repository
   cannot meaningfully pin a commit of itself, and the pin is the evidence C5
   rests on.
3. A separate repository keeps the challenge outside the main session's
   ordinary write scope; modifying it requires explicit owner authorization
   (`local/personas/main.md`).

What stays here: the generator (`scripts/comparator/`), the expected copy, the
drift check, and the comparator record. Creating the challenge repository is an
action outside this repository and is therefore an **owner action**, not a main
decision.

## 4. Who enforces this

The main session, or the acting main, **may not** post a completion statement
on the track's umbrella issues, close them, or tag a release unless

    python3 scripts/completion_gate.py check --track <track>

exits 0 on the exact commit being declared, and the gate's output is attached
to the completion comment. A gate run on any other commit is not evidence.

A failing gate is **not an owner blocker**. It is main's to-do list: no owner
inbox comment is filed for it, and the work it names is ordinary development.

The gate is deliberately **not** part of the blocking PR CI: it would fail every
PR until the comparator challenge exists. `local/bin/ci.sh` has no non-blocking
step class — every step it records is blocking — so CI is left unchanged, and
the gate is run by hand before a completion statement.

## 5. The gate

`scripts/completion_gate.py` is python3, standard library only, no network and
no model call. `check --track <t> [--repo-root R] [--commit C] [--json]` prints
one PASS/FAIL line per criterion with `file:line` evidence, and exits 0 only
when every mechanically checkable criterion passes. Criteria with a half that
needs a run the gate does not perform (C2 axiom values, C4 `--ci` run, C5 drift
regeneration, C7 snapshot leak scan, C8 honesty of
the ledger) print as
`DELEGATED` once their static half holds — never as `PASS`, so no completion
comment can quote a green line for a check nobody ran — while a failing static
half is still `FAIL`. `DELEGATED` does not turn a failing run green and does
not by itself make one green either: the delegated halves are read off the CI
run of the same commit, and C8's from the quantitative survey and independent
review linked in the completion comment. Unit tests:
`scripts/tests/test_completion_gate.py`.

## 6. Registered tracks

Headline theorems (blueprint chapter `ch13_qpbt_test.tex`):

| Lean name | Blueprint node |
|---|---|
| `MIPStarRE.QPBT.pauli_soundness` | `thm:pauli` |
| `MIPStarRE.QPBT.pauli_soundness_qubit` | `cor:pauli-binary` |
| `MIPStarRE.QPBT.exists_spcc_value_one` | `lem:pauli-completeness` |
| `MIPStarRE.QPBT.exists_ld_soundness` | `lem:ld-soundness` |

The expected challenge is the split tree generated from
`scripts/comparator/challenges/qpbt.json`: its root `Challenge.lean` and
mirrored modules together must name all four headline declarations above.
The gate reads every Lean file in that registered tree, checks coverage against
the headline table rather than the hand-written comparator record, and still
requires the record's expected-copy path to agree exactly. Comparator
verification remains delegated evidence: the record must name a verified
ancestor revision, the official run must permit only the three standard
axioms, and the drift check must establish agreement at the completion commit.

The `Blueprint chapters` row is the track's own chapters, read whole; it is
not the whole of C4's scope. The gate also reads every other `.tex` file in
those directories whose `\lean{...}` names a declaration under the track's
Lean root and judges those nodes — today
`blueprint/src/chapter/ch03_preliminaries.tex` carries one such QPBT node — so
a chapter missing from the row above narrows nothing.

Adding a track means adding its row set here and its entry in the gate's
`TRACKS` registry, in one commit; a unit test reads this section and fails if a
registry entry names a path these rows do not. That test reads every
path-valued field of `Track` — every row above but the umbrella issues — and
fails as well when `Track` gains or loses a field without a line in the test,
so the rule cannot quietly stop covering part of the registry.
