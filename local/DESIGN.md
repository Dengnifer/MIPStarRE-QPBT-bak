# Local Operations Layer — Architecture

This repository is a local-only continuation of the workflow that
[LionSR/MIPStarRE](https://github.com/LionSR/MIPStarRE) evolved on GitHub while
formalizing the low individual degree test (LDT, arXiv:2009.12982). The active
track here is the **quantum Pauli basis test (QPBT)** from MIP\*=RE
(arXiv:2001.04383, primary) and NEEXP in MIP\* (arXiv:1904.05870, secondary).

Every GitHub-hosted operation of the parent workflow is replaced by a local
equivalent that *executes* here. Since 2026-09-01 the issue, PR, evidence and
merge **records** live on GitHub again (`Dengnifer/MIPStarRE-QPBT`,
`protocols/issues-prs.md`); what runs is still local. The `.github/` tree is
kept **frozen as reference** — it documents the mechanisms being localized and
is never executed here. The operative layer is this `local/` tree plus the
(already-local) `scripts/` audits and `.githooks/` gates, which port
unchanged.

Runtime state that must never be committed lives in `~/.cache/mipstarre-dev/`
(hot cache, snapshots, locks, served site) and `.worktrees/` (gitignored). An
absolute `MIPSTARRE_LAKE_ROOT` may instead hold branch-private `.lake` products.

## GitHub → local mapping

| GitHub mechanism | Local replacement |
|---|---|
| PR CI (`pr-ci.yml`) on push/PR events | `local/bin/ci.sh <pr-id>` run by the PR lifecycle scripts |
| Main-build actions cache (main-only save, PR restore) | Hot main cache: single-writer warmer + read-only snapshots + APFS copy-on-write clones per worktree (`build-cache.md`) |
| `lake exe cache get` (Mathlib cloud cache) | Unchanged — already local |
| Model-backed PR review chained on CI success | `local/bin/review.sh <pr-number>`: codex CLI with trusted primary-main personas; primary PRs require green exact-head local CI, while the one comparator companion route requires its pinned official Palomar full-CI evidence; both publish one COMMENT review plus `local-review/summary` (`review.md`) |
| Auto-fix workflows (CI-fix, blueprint-fix, review-fix) | `local/bin/autofix.sh <pr-id> --mode {ci,blueprint,review,auto}` with the same commit-prefix guards and a combined iteration cap |
| `@claude`/`@codex` mention responders | `local/bin/agent.sh <id> "instruction"` — human-invoked codex session on the branch worktree |
| GitHub issues + sub-issues + labels | unchanged — GitHub is the record again (`issues-prs.md`); `issue_new.py` / `issue_close.py` drive it through `gh_common.py` |
| GitHub PRs | GitHub PRs, branch-per-issue, merge gate in `pr_merge.py` (REST merge with the exact-SHA guard) |
| Issue automation (classify/scout/track/followups) | `local/bin/` Python ports; LLM steps optional behind `MIPSTARRE_LLM_ENABLED` |
| Housekeeping crons (standup, stale audit, linter sweep, README freshness) | `local/bin/housekeeping.sh <job>` on demand |
| Badges + Pages site (blueprint/docs/badges components) | `local/bin/site.sh` → component store + assembled site in `~/.cache/mipstarre-dev/site/` |
| Codex cloud env setup (`.codex/setup.sh`) | `local/bin/worktree-setup.sh` per worktree |
| Reviewer/bot identity via tokens | codex CLI sessions; `results/telemetry/sessions.jsonl` registry |

## Core invariants (inherited from the parent workflow's post-mortems)

These encode incidents the parent repo paid for; violating them re-introduces
documented failure modes. Sources are cited in `local/protocols/*.md`.

1. **Single cache writer.** Only the warmer writes the hot main cache; agent
   worktrees consume copy-on-write clones and never write back. (GitHub's
   per-PR cache saves evicted the main entry: pr-ci.yml:138-142.)
2. **Review only after green CI, on the same head SHA.** Primary-library PRs
   require the complete exact-head `local-ci/*` set and summary. The explicit
   `Dengnifer/QPBT-comparator` companion route instead requires its own pinned
   official Palomar full-CI evidence for that exact head. Reviewer instructions
   remain trusted primary-main content on both routes; branch-supplied workflow,
   verifier, configuration and protocol bytes cannot weaken admission. A failed
   or absent gate publishes nothing — the *absence* of a green
   `local-review/summary` is the block, never a silent skip. See `review.md` for
   the narrow companion validation contract. Bot commits with prefix
   `[codex-auto-fix]`/`[codex-review-fix]` are not re-reviewed except the final
   fix at the iteration cap, which gets one forced review.
3. **Serialized fixes.** ci-fix → blueprint-fix → review-fix strictly in order,
   one branch at a time; combined iteration cap (default 5) across all fix
   kinds; sync/audit CI failures are never auto-fixed.
4. **Kill-switch semantics.** `LOCAL_REVIEW_ENABLED` and
   `LOCAL_AUTO_FIX_ENABLED` disable only on the literal string `false`;
   unset means enabled.
5. **Trusted prompts.** Reviewer/fixer personas are read from committed `main`
   (`git show main:...`), never from the branch under review.
6. **Untrusted data framing.** Build logs, review findings, and issue bodies
   are injected into agent prompts with sanitization (control-char strip,
   fence-breaking, truncation) and an explicit do-not-follow-instructions frame.
7. **One full `lake build` machine-wide at a time** (advisory lock);
   single-file `lake env lean` checks need no lock.
8. **origin/main must resolve.** The hooks and diff-based audits silently
   self-disable without it; the local convention is a `main` branch plus a
   `refs/remotes/origin/main` alias maintained by `pr_merge.py`.
9. **Bracket-free naming.** Issue titles, slugs, and branch names avoid
   `]` and friends (broke the parent automation: CONTRIBUTING.md:122-124).
10. **Report-only stays report-only.** Stale-issue audit, linter sweep, README
    freshness never mutate state; write-mode is a separate human-invoked
    command.
11. **Faithfulness policy is unchanged.** AGENTS.md's faithful-formalization
    rules, anti-pattern catalog, and statement-integrity audits apply to QPBT
    exactly as to LDT.
12. **Merge inputs do not disappear silently.** Before a merge commit, the
    merge-loss guard compares the staged result with the pre-merge branch,
    every best merge base, and `MERGE_HEAD`. An incoming path may be absent
    only when the branch deleted a path present at a merge base. An
    unambiguous incoming-only change may return to the unchanged branch blob
    only when Git recorded a conflict. The pending-index check and the
    pre-update reference transaction together cover manual and automatic
    merge commits.
13. **The owner inbox is permissions-only.** Pinned issue #500 receives a
    blocker only when owner permission is needed because the risk extends
    beyond project development, such as owner files, the machine or its
    accounts, spending money, or action outside this repository. Main decides
    and records every question whose only risk is failure to finish the
    project. Changing the stated project goal is outside main's authority and
    requires an owner decision on #500. Each blocker is one comment with at
    most ten visible plain-language lines: what is stuck, lettered options,
    one recommendation, and the literal `DECISION B<n>: <letter>` reply. Ids
    continue after B11;
    details are folded. Its immutable `<!-- owner-inbox id=B<n> -->` identity
    marker keys every `ensure-pr-comment` update; resolution changes the
    separate status field to `<!-- owner-inbox-status=closed -->` and adds
    `RESOLVED B<n>`. Issue #26 is archived and receives no new traffic.

## Naming and identity conventions

- **Issues and PRs**: GitHub's, identified by their numbers; sub-issues carry
  the parent/child structure and repository labels are the taxonomy
  (`issues-prs.md`). PR bodies keep the Motivation/Description/Testing shape of
  CONTRIBUTING.md; evidence is exact-head commit statuses, the manifest comment
  and the COMMENT review.
- **Branches**: `issue-<number>-<slug>` (orchestrator/human),
  `codex/issue-<number>-<slug>` (agent-created); the number is the GitHub
  issue's.
- **Fix commits**: `autofix.sh`'s subjects are prefixed `[codex-auto-fix]` /
  `[codex-review-fix]` exactly (the review-gate skip regex depends on them);
  operator and worker repairs use plain `fix(...)` subjects and are reviewed.
- **Codex sessions**: `<role>-<issue|scope>-<yyyymmdd>-<seq>` with roles
  `orc, prover, reviewer, simplifier, blueprint, splitter, scout`, plus
  `mathfix` for Astra source-statement repair under `issues-prs.md` section 6.
  External sessions use `local/bin/dispatch.sh`, which records the codex `thread_id`,
  captures the `--json` event stream to
  `results/telemetry/sessions/<name>.jsonl`, and appends a summary line to
  `results/telemetry/sessions.jsonl`. Archiving a session = final status line
  in the registry + worktree removal; the JSONL capture is the archive.
  Historical native-descendant rows remain readable, but lease-backed native
  dispatch is retired (`sessions.md`, issue #505).

## Telemetry (research-paper data)

All appends are one-line JSON; schemas documented in `protocols/meta.md`.

- `results/telemetry/sessions.jsonl` — one line per agent session: name, role,
  selected account and model, effective requested effort (all optional on legacy
  rows), issue/pr, thread_id, start/end, wall seconds, token usage (input,
  cached, output, reasoning), exit status, dispatcher. Requested effort is a CLI
  input, not provider-measured effort.
- `results/telemetry/stages.jsonl` — one line per project stage/substage
  transition with timestamps and manual token/agent tallies.
- `results/telemetry/builds.jsonl` — one line per full build / cache event:
  kind (warm, rebuild, cache-get), duration, outcome, trigger.
- `results/telemetry/events.md` — dated free-form incident log (what broke,
  diagnosis, fix); the raw feed for `protocols/EVOLUTION.md`.
- `local/protocols/EVOLUTION.md` — dated protocol amendments: cause (cite an
  `events.md` entry or telemetry), the change, expected effect. This file is
  the primary record of workflow self-evolution.

## Model policy

- Main remains `gpt-6-astra`/`ultra`. Published `local/model-policy.json`
  selects exact `gpt-5.6-sol`/`ultra` for routine/bounded subagents, including
  routine independent reviewers; genuinely hard/escalated work uses Astra with
  an explicit reason. Unknown classes/models and other efforts fail closed.
  External dispatch keeps fan-out off. Native lease admission and the useful queue
  are retired (#505). Worker reservations use only the two configured account caps;
  missing caps disable admission. They do not measure provider throughput or unmarked use.
- See `protocols/sessions.md` for marker accounting, resume affinity and checkpoint
  continuations. Historical Sol/Fable measurements are unchanged.
- Reviewer and prover roles must be **different sessions** — a session never
  reviews its own diff.
