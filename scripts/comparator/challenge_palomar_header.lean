# Challenge: compact quantum Pauli basis test

This standalone Mathlib-only module states the compact forms of Pauli-basis
completeness, low-degree soundness, Pauli soundness, and binary-coordinate
Pauli soundness.  It preserves the complete question and answer carriers, all
verifier branches, bounded polynomial representatives, the fixed field and
basis contract, the unsquared state error, and the separate unaveraged squared
operator-error sums.

The four theorem values and the value of `MIPStarRE.QPBT.fixedFieldModel` are
the only intended holes.  The comparator checks the registered definition's
full type and checks its library value transitively for permitted axioms.
