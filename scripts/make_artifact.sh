# make_artifact.sh — cut the ITP artifact snapshot from a tagged commit.
#
# The artifact is a RELEASE SNAPSHOT of the mathematical development, not the
# working repository (acting-main decision, 2026-09-19; the reviewer-facing
# description lives in docs/ARTIFACT.md).  Two independent mechanisms decide
# what ships, and a path must pass both:
#
#   1. the INCLUDE pathspecs below — an explicit allow-list, so a new top-level
#      directory never joins the artifact by accident;
#   2. the `export-ignore` attributes in .gitattributes, which `git archive`
#      applies on its own — so a plain `git archive` of this repository is
#      clean too.
#
# Excluded on purpose: the AI-workflow layer (results/telemetry/, local/,
# .github/, .githooks/, workflow-only scripts and docs).  Dropping it also
# removes every tracked file that mentions the build host's home path, without
# rewriting history.
#
# INCLUDED on purpose: the third-party paper sources under references/ (owner
# decision, 2026-09-19, following the companion LDT repository, which keeps its
# paper sources in the public repository).  They are what the Lean docstrings,
# the theorem index and the deviations page cite by `<file>.tex:<lines>`, so a
# snapshot without them cannot be checked against its sources.  They are
# third-party material kept for reference and are NOT covered by the Apache-2.0
# LICENSE that ships with the snapshot; the MANIFEST and docs/ARTIFACT.md say so.
#
# The script FAILS on a leak-scan hit.  That is the point: a snapshot that
# leaks a home path, a key-shaped string or an e-mail address is not shipped.
# The scan reads text, so any PDF in the snapshot has its text extracted with
# `pdftotext` first; if that is not possible the run stops rather than ship a
# binary nothing looked inside.  Generated PDFs are built after the
# anonymization pass, because `sed` cannot reach inside a finished PDF.

Usage: scripts/make_artifact.sh [options] <git-ref> <out-dir>

Cut the ITP artifact snapshot of the mathematical development from <git-ref>
and write a gzipped tarball plus its MANIFEST into <out-dir>.

Options:
  --anonymize   also rewrite the author-identifying strings listed in the
                script (for a double-blind venue); tags the tarball "-anon".
                The run stops rather than package a snapshot in which one of
                those strings survived the rewrite.
  --keep-tree   leave the unpacked snapshot beside the tarball for inspection.
  --no-pdf      skip the gap-note PDF build even when its Makefile is present.
  -h, --help    this text.

Building the gap-note PDFs needs pdftotext (poppler-utils) as well, because a
PDF in the snapshot is scanned for leaks through its extracted text.

Exit status: 0 packaged, 1 usage or environment error, 2 the leak scan or the
anonymization check failed.
See docs/ARTIFACT.md for what ships, what does not, and why.
