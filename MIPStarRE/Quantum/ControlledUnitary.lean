# Finite controlled unitaries

A complete projective measurement controls a family of operators on a second
finite-dimensional space. Orthogonality of the measurement effects makes
multiplication of the resulting operator sums componentwise. In particular,
unitary components give a unitary controlled operator.

These are formalization-only algebraic lemmas, not the extraction theorem:
they do not construct the global measurement or establish the Pauli relations.

For finite square matrices, a left inverse is also a right inverse, both for each
component and for the controlled operator.
This supplies the reverse identity implicit in the same source calculation. -/
