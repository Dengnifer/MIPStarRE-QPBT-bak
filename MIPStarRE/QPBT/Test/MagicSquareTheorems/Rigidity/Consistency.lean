# Cross-player agreement of the Magic Square variable measurements

The rigidity theorem `thm:ms-rigidity` is false for arbitrary strategies of the
role-symmetric Magic Square game: its conclusion forces the two players'
`Variable_1` and `Variable_5` measurements to agree on the shared state, and the
game never tests that agreement.  The corrected statement adopted on issue #172
(owner decision B5 on issue #26; the note is
`docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_ms-rigidity-symmetric-strategies.tex`) assumes that
agreement, quantitatively.  The *variable-measurement agreement distance* at a
variable is the summed squared state-dependent distance between Alice's and
Bob's binary variable effects on the shared state, in the `≈_δ` convention of
`def:povm-distance`, and the corrected theorem bounds it at the paper's first
and fifth variables.

That distance is not the consistency defect of `def:consistency`, which is the
off-diagonal outcome weight of a pair of measurements (`consistencyDefect`); it
is the squared state-dependent distance `opFamilyDistSq` of
`def:povm-distance`.  In the declaration name `msVariableConsistencyDefect` the
word `Consistency` records the failure of the two players' variable
measurements to be consistent with one another, which is what the distance
measures, and not the defect of `def:consistency`; the blueprint states the
distinction as `rem:ms-variable-agreement-name`.  The name itself is kept
unchanged because the rigidity assembly of issue #105 is stated in terms of it.

This file defines that distance on the original, possibly non-projective,
strategy and relates it to the reflections of the projective dilation on which
the self-testing argument operates.

* For a symmetric strategy whose variable measurements are consistent in the
  exact sense of `def:consistent-measurement`, the distance vanishes, so the
  corrected theorem specializes to the symmetric consistent strategies named in
  the owner decision.
* The two players' dilated variable reflections `msVarObsA S j` and
  `msVarObsB S j` are close on the dilated state whenever that distance is
  small.
  The loss is the leakage of the dilated observables out of the ground slice,
  which `Rigidity/Transfer.lean` controls by the cell-consistency masses of a
  strategy of value `1 - ε`.  This is the cross-player input that the
  swap-isometry extraction of issue #105 needs in order to compare the two
  players' extracted qubits.

/-! ## The agreement distance of a variable measurement -/

/-- The variable-measurement agreement distance between the two players'
binary measurements at the variable `j` of a Magic Square strategy: the summed
squared state-dependent distance `∑_b ‖(A_b ⊗ 1 - 1 ⊗ B_b) ψ‖²` of
`def:povm-distance` between Alice's and Bob's `Variable_j` effects, relabelled
to a bit by `msBitOrZero`, on the shared state.  The corrected
`thm:ms-rigidity` (blueprint `def:ms-variable-agreement` and
`thm:ms-rigidity` in `ch13_qpbt_test.tex`, correction recorded in
`docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_ms-rigidity-symmetric-strategies.tex`) assumes this
distance to be at most `δ` at the cells `0` and `4`.

The word `Consistency` in the declaration name records the failure of the two
players' variable measurements to be consistent with one another, which is what
the distance measures.  The quantity itself is the squared state-dependent
distance `opFamilyDistSq` of `def:povm-distance`, not the outcome-disagreement
weight `consistencyDefect` of `def:consistency`; the blueprint records the
distinction as `rem:ms-variable-agreement-name`.

The distance vanishes for a symmetric strategy whose variable measurements are
consistent in the sense of `def:consistent-measurement`, paper
`references/qpbt-paper/06_nonlocal_games_and_mipstar.tex:144-160`; see
`msVariableConsistencyDefect_eq_zero_of_isConsistent`. -/
