# The second logical Pauli pair of the Magic Square

The ideal Magic Square strategy assigns to the nine cells the two-qubit Pauli
observables

    X ⊗ I     I ⊗ X     X ⊗ X
    I ⊗ Z     Z ⊗ I     Z ⊗ Z
    X ⊗ Z     Z ⊗ X     Y ⊗ Y

read in the zero-based cell order `0, …, 8`.  The rigidity argument extracts
two EPR pairs, one for each tensor factor of this assignment, and therefore
needs two anticommuting pairs of reflections per player.  The chain of issues
#101--#104 supplies the *first* pair, at the cells `0` and `4` (the paper's
`Variable_1` and `Variable_5`), whose ideal images `X ⊗ I` and `Z ⊗ I` act on
the first qubit: `msVarObsA_anticommute` and `msVarObsB_anticommute` in
`Rigidity/Anticommutation.lean`.

This file supplies the *second* pair, at the cells `1` and `3` (the paper's
`Variable_2` and `Variable_4`), whose ideal images `I ⊗ X` and `I ⊗ Z` act on
the second qubit.  Two points distinguish it from the first pair.

* The corrected `thm:ms-rigidity` assumes cross-player consistency only at the
  cells `0` and `4` (`msVariableConsistencyDefect`, `Rigidity/Consistency.lean`),
  so the two players' *variable* reflections at the cells `1` and `3` cannot be
  compared.  The second pair is therefore carried by Alice's *constraint-read*
  reflections `msCellObsA S 0 1` (cell `1`, read from the first row) and
  `msCellObsA S 1 0` (cell `3`, read from the second row) against Bob's variable
  reflections `msVarObsB S 1` and `msVarObsB S 3`.  The game tests exactly this
  orientation, through `msCellObsA_close_msVarObsB`, so no further hypothesis is
  needed.
* Their approximate anticommutation is the solution-group computation of
  `Rigidity/Anticommutation.lean` carried out along a second closed path through
  the grid, namely
  `(1, 3) → (2, 6) → (5, 7) → (3, 1)`,
  which traverses the exceptional third column once and therefore returns the
  reversed product with the opposite sign.

The file also records the approximate commutation between the two pairs, which
the two-qubit swap-isometry extraction needs in order to treat the two extracted
qubits as independent registers.  On Alice's side that relation passes once
through the consistency hypothesis; on Bob's side it passes through Alice's
reflections at a shared constraint and needs no consistency.

/-! ## Approximate anticommutation of the second pair -/

/-- The two reflections that Alice reads at the cells of the paper's second and
fourth variables, from the first and the second row, approximately anticommute
on the dilated state.  These are the operators whose ideal images are
`I ⊗ σ^X` and `I ⊗ σ^Z`, and they are the second player-local anticommuting
pair required by the two-qubit swap-isometry extraction of `thm:ms-rigidity`.

The closed path of `msCellObsA_second_pair_path` gives the scale
`504 * sqrt ε`, and the two endpoint substitutions add `24 * sqrt ε` each, so
the argument closes at `552 * sqrt ε`; the bound is stated at the scale
`624 * sqrt ε` of the first-pair estimate `msVarObsA_anticommute`, so that the
assembly may use one scale for both pairs.  Blueprint `thm:ms-rigidity`, paper

/-- Alice's variable reflection at a cell of the first logical pair
approximately commutes on the dilated state with her constraint-read reflection
at a cell of the second logical pair, provided some constraint contains both
cells.  The hypothesis `hik` names the position of the variable cell `j` in that
constraint, and `hcell` says that the constraint-read reflection is attached to
the same cell as the position `l` of that constraint.

This is the inter-pair commutation on Alice's side.  Unlike Bob's, it passes
once through the consistency hypothesis of the corrected `thm:ms-rigidity`,
because the game does not compare Alice's variable reflection with her own
constraint-read reflection at the same cell.  Applied with `j = 0, 4` and the
second-pair reflections `msCellObsA S 0 1` and `msCellObsA S 1 0`, it gives the
