# Coefficient polynomials and finite-field collision bounds

This module supplies the coefficient evaluation and polynomial representation
shared by the low-degree games and the combining argument. Distinct bounded
coefficient vectors agree at no more parameters than their degree bound.

of the QPBT headline theorems, which must elaborate in the same environment as
the Mathlib-only `ChallengeQPBT.lean`.  Keep the full `import Mathlib`; do not
