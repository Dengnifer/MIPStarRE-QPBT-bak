/-! # Capped scalar envelope for direct-game error bounds

This module gives a concrete polynomial envelope for a scalar expression assembled from
seven prospective rejection bounds in the directly indexed extended-line game. It is a
formalization-only arithmetic auxiliary: it does not prove that any game branch satisfies
one of these bounds, nor does it prove a passing-value theorem.

The cap by one records the independent fact that a rejection probability is at most one.
It is essential for the polynomial-error contract: the uncapped function
`2 * x + Real.sqrt x + y` cannot be bounded by one positive power of `x` both near zero
and at infinity.
