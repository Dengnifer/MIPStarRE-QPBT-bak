# Applying the classical low-degree test

This module states the two application obligations at the end of the Pauli-basis
combining argument.  Directly indexed combined-line measurements are recorded both
with the error form printed in the source, as an unasserted proposition, and with
the weaker estimate established by its first proof route, as a theorem.  The
final witness consists of a projective measurement of a
pair of global bounded individual-degree polynomials.  The existence assertions below
record the measurements and quantitative estimates required by the combining argument.
The established direct-line constructor, its conditional supplied-point companion,
and the source global-pair theorem are proved.  The printed error form of the
combined-line lemma remains an open source gap, tracked by issue #598; it is
recorded here as a proposition that is stated but not asserted, so this module
contains no proof debt.

/-! The directly indexed obligations below share the extended-line carrier.
The first records the error expression printed in the source as a proposition
that is stated but not asserted; it is a source-gap record, not a theorem.
The second is the conditional auxiliary for a polynomially controlled supplied
point family, carrying the error the first proof route establishes; the third
supplies that family existentially and is the official formalization of what
the source proof establishes at this node. -/

/-- The assertion printed as the conclusion of `lem:qld-4-13`, paper lines
1020--1034, recorded in Lean **without being asserted**.

This is a `Prop`-valued definition, not a theorem, so writing it down commits
the development to nothing. It replaced a theorem of exactly this statement
whose proof was an open `sorry`; the printed sentence of the source therefore
stays visible in Lean and is neither marked proved nor removed, while no proof
debt is carried at this site. The blueprint node `lem:qld-4-13` links this
definition and carries no formalization mark. What the source proof does
establish is formalized by `exists_extendedLinesWitness_established` below,
whose blueprint node is `lem:qld-4-13-established`; that theorem is what every
consumer uses, in particular `exists_globalPairWitness`.

**Why the printed form is not asserted.** The error expression
`poly(m ^ 2 * epsilon, md / q)` is delivered by neither of the two derivations
printed in the source proof. The first route establishes
`C * m * poly(epsilon, md / q)`. The second route would give
`m ^ 2 * poly(epsilon, md / q)` and needs in addition a joint product law for
the two sampled points that Property 2 of `lem:qld-sublines` does not supply;
the directly indexed decomposition `subLineDist_map_joint` and its consequence
`subLineDist_consistencyDefect_le_ofLinesWitness`, which gives `4 * m^2 * δP`
for a supplied line witness, do not discharge that premise.

**Why it is not refuted either.** `not_exists_combining_quarter_power_bound`
(`MIPStarRE/QPBT/Combining/ErrorObstruction.lean`) proves the scalar
obstruction that the first route's term `m * epsilon ^ (1 / 4)` cannot be
absorbed into the printed error arguments, even after capping it by one and
restricting to admissible parameters. That obstructs the first route; it is
not a counterexample to this proposition, since an upper bound on a defect
need not be attained. No implication between this proposition and the
established theorem is recorded in either direction: the printed form feeds
`m ^ 2 * epsilon` to an arbitrary `IsPolyErr₂` function, whose exponent may
exceed the single factor `m` that the established form carries outside, so
neither direction follows by a short faithful argument.

**Carrier caveat.** Like the established forms below, this proposition uses the
directly indexed questions, the directly indexed line-point law, and the
`Option`-completed answer alphabet, so it is not the source-facing paper
statement even as regards its carrier; only its error expression is the printed
one. Those three replacements are documented in
`docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_ld-dimension-divisibility.tex` and
`docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_combined-lines-error-term.tex`.

The full analysis of the gap is
`docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_combined-lines-error-term.tex`, and it is tracked by
issue #598. Issues #509 and #510 were closed by their obstruction pull requests
without a proof of the printed assertion, and are not reopened.

**Error contract:** the polynomial bound printed in the source is carried
by `IsPolyErr₂`, which states the corrected sum form
`f x y ≤ C * (x ^ r + y ^ s)` with `1 ≤ C` and positive exponents on the
closed nonnegative quadrant, in place of the product form `C * (x * y) ^ C`
of the source shorthand at `04_preliminaries.tex:22-29`.  The correction and
the two-dimensional strategy that refutes the product form are recorded in
`docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_pasting-product-error.tex` and tracked by issue #196.
Here `poly(m^2 * epsilon, md / q)` is read in that sense. -/

/-- Conditional existence of extended-line measurements with the first-route
estimate `C * m * poly(epsilon, md / q)`, for a polynomially controlled supplied
point family.

This conditional auxiliary uses the error form established by the first proof
route. It is not the source-labelled `lem:qld-4-13` and must not be advertised as
that theorem; the source discrepancy is analyzed in
`docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_combined-lines-error-term.tex` and tracked by issue #598.
As in the companion directly indexed declarations, the extended questions use the
directly indexed line-space construction and the comparisons use the completed
answer alphabet. Relating its game to the source's seed-bearing game requires the
transport and soundness obligations in
`docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_ld-dimension-divisibility.tex`. The conditional blueprint
entry is `lem:qld-4-13-established-given-points`.

**Domain repair (issue #511):** the former statement quantified over an arbitrary
scalar point error `δQ` after choosing the line error, although that line error
must depend on the supplied point error. As stated it was false: the supplied
family may answer deterministically with a quadratic in the point coordinates at
zero strategy error, whose axis-line defect stays bounded below as `q` grows,
while any `IsPolyErr₂` bound tends to zero there. The repaired domain takes the
point-error function `deltaQ` with its control hypothesis `IsPolyErr deltaQ`
before choosing the line error, and assumes a point witness at `deltaQ ε`, which
is exactly the family supplied by `exists_combinedPointsWitness`. This repeats one
level up the issue #389 repair of `exists_combinedLinesWitness_ofPointsWitness`.
The refutation of the former domain, and the provenance of the removed printed-form
companion `exists_extendedLinesWitness_ofPointsWitness` of issue #509, are preserved in
`docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_combined-lines-error-term.tex`. The established dimension
factor `C * m` is kept explicit in the conclusion rather than absorbed.

**Error contract:** the polynomial bound printed in the source is carried
by `IsPolyErr₂`, which states the corrected sum form
`f x y ≤ C * (x ^ r + y ^ s)` with `1 ≤ C` and positive exponents on the
closed nonnegative quadrant, in place of the product form `C * (x * y) ^ C`
of the source shorthand at `04_preliminaries.tex:22-29`.  The correction and
the two-dimensional strategy that refutes the product form are recorded in
`docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_pasting-product-error.tex` and tracked by issue #196.
Here `poly(epsilon, md / q)` is read in that sense.

The proof uses the point, line, and subline constructions together with both
opposite-placement comparisons. -/

/-- Directly indexed construction for the auxiliary estimate

alphabet is documented in `docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_combined-lines-error-term.tex`.
Transport to `lem:qld-4-13` must convert this completed comparison to the source's

/-- Construction of the projective global polynomial-pair measurements from
`lem:qld-4-7`, paper lines 1267--1274.  The statement has the source's universal
constants and contains no divisibility hypothesis or residual construction input.

The argument uses low-degree soundness at dimension `2 * m + 2`.  The current
direct carrier realizes the required dimension without assuming
`2 * m + 2 ∣ q`.  `exists_direct_ld_soundness` proves that soundness statement
for the directly indexed game by applying `MIPStarRE.LDT.Test.mainFormal` and
verifying `400 M d <= N` at each LDT application dimension `M`, with sampling
count `N = 2560000 M^3 d`.  At seed-indexed dimension `M`, the source instead
chooses `K = M^3 d` while invoking a tensor-code theorem that requires
`K >= 12 M (d + 1)`, and it asserts a correspondence with the tensor-code game.
The direct proof establishes neither assertion.  Both remain open and are documented in
`docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_ld-dimension-divisibility.tex`.

The independent algebraic restriction, projective completion, and retained-overlap
estimates remain available in `PairCompletion.lean`.

The proof below composes the established direct-line construction with the actual
rounded polynomial-pair construction. Its four defects are bounded both by one
and by the constructed error. `exists_actual_rounded_global_pair_error_bound`
absorbs their minimum, including the eighth-root rounding term and both point
and line errors, for every nonnegative strategy error. This alternative proof
does not require an identification with the source's seed-bearing auxiliary game.
