# Combined lines and restricted line distributions

This module states the construction of the joint X/Z line measurements, the
mixture and error-inflation estimates for restricted line distributions, and
the sub-line distribution used to combine the two bases.  The extended line
in the sub-line construction uses the directly indexed carrier, so the
sub-line statement is a formalization auxiliary assertion and carries no
divisibility hypothesis at dimension `2 * m + 2`.

## References

The declarations formalize `lem:qld-xz-lines` and
`lem:restricted-line-mixture-bounds` in
`blueprint/src/chapter/ch15_qpbt_combining.tex`; `exists_subLineWitness`
instead supports `lem:qld-sublines` through the directly indexed extended-line
carrier and probability law.  Their paper sources
are `references/qpbt-paper/14_analysis_of_the_pauli_basis_test.tex:882-894`

/-! ## Combined line measurements -/


/-- Conditional joint X/Z line measurements for a polynomially controlled
point-witness family supporting `lem:qld-xz-lines`.

**Conditional auxiliary supporting:** blueprint
`lem:qld-xz-lines`, from
`references/qpbt-paper/14_analysis_of_the_pauli_basis_test.tex:882-894`.
The matching conditional blueprint entry is `lem:combined-lines-given-points`.
The error depends polynomially on `ε` and `md/q`, and the witness retains all
directed opposite-placement comparisons. This formalization-only conditional form
takes the supplied point-error function `deltaQ` and its bound `hdeltaQ : IsPolyErr deltaQ`
before choosing the line-error function. It also assumes a supplied point witness
`points : CombinedPointsWitness S (deltaQ ε)` at strategy error `ε`.
The separate source-facing declaration `exists_combinedLinesWitness` supplies
the point-error function, its bound, and the point witness existentially.
The comparisons here use the completed answer alphabet; the conditional entry
does not certify the source comparison on field-valued answers.

**Domain repair (issue #389):** The former statement quantified an arbitrary
scalar point error after choosing `deltaP`, although the pasting estimate depends
on that point error.  The repaired domain matches the point family supplied by
`exists_combinedPointsWitness`.  The source-facing theorem below still supplies
that family existentially and has an unchanged statement.  The obstruction and
the named construction obligations are recorded in
`docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_combined-lines-error-term.tex`.

The witness below uses `S.combinedLineMeasurement` explicitly. Its consistency
is proved by the point-to-line comparisons and pasting construction; see
`docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_subline-claims-line-marginal.tex` and issue #414.

**Error contract:** the polynomial bound printed in the source is carried
by `IsPolyErr₂`, which states the corrected sum form
`f x y ≤ C * (x ^ r + y ^ s)` with `1 ≤ C` and positive exponents on the
closed nonnegative quadrant, in place of the product form `C * (x * y) ^ C`
of the source shorthand at `04_preliminaries.tex:22-29`.  The correction and
the two-dimensional strategy that refutes the product form are recorded in
`docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_pasting-product-error.tex` and tracked by issue #196.
Here `poly(ε, md/q)` is read in that sense. -/

/-! The source-facing declaration below supplies the point witness produced by
`lem:qld-4-10` existentially.  The `_ofPointsWitness` companion above is the
conditional form for a supplied polynomially controlled point family. -/

/-- The source-facing joint X/Z line measurement construction of
`lem:qld-xz-lines`, paper lines 882--894.

Unlike the formalization-only `_ofPointsWitness` companion, this declaration
does not assume a `CombinedPointsWitness` as an external bridge input.  It
quantifies the point error function and witness construction together with the
line construction, as the preceding source lemma supplies those points.

The proof constructs the line witness with `T := S.combinedLineMeasurement`.
The line consistency is proved by `combined_line_measurement_consistency`,
from paper lines 942--961 and documented in
`docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_subline-claims-line-marginal.tex`.
Downstream arguments requiring the construction use that consistency theorem
and the same explicit record, rather than an unspecified existential witness.

by `IsPolyErr₂`, which states the corrected sum form
`f x y ≤ C * (x ^ r + y ^ s)` with `1 ≤ C` and positive exponents on the

/-! ## Restricted line distributions -/

/-- The axis and diagonal line-point laws are uniform mixtures of their
coordinate-index restrictions.

**Formalization-only auxiliary:** blueprint
`lem:restricted-line-mixture-bounds`, which states the mixture over the
refined, seed-bearing line laws of `def:ith-restricted-line`.  This
decomposes those refined laws and is not a formalization of a source
statement: the unlabelled prose at
`references/qpbt-paper/14_analysis_of_the_pauli_basis_test.tex:1049-1051`
speaks of the source laws, and identifying the corresponding source
push-forwards remains an open obligation recorded in
`docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_ld-dimension-divisibility.tex`, section
`sec:auxiliary-subline-scalars`.
`Distribution.bind` is the finite uniform-mixture operation.  The two halves
are proved from the equal-fiber decomposition of `chiIndex` and the fact that
every line conditioning map retains the shared scalar seed. -/
theorem linePointDist_eq_mixture_restricted (L : LdParams) :
    aLinePointDist L =
        Distribution.bind (uniformDistribution (Fin L.m))

/-- Restricting a nonnegative average from the line-point distribution to one
fixed line kind and coordinate inflates its bound by at most `2m`.

**Formalization-only auxiliary:** item 1 of blueprint
`lem:restricted-line-mixture-bounds`, stated over the refined, seed-bearing
line laws of `def:ith-restricted-line`.  It is a consequence of that refined
mixture, not a formalization of a source estimate: the unlabelled prose at

speaks of the source laws, and identifying the corresponding source
push-forwards remains an open obligation recorded in
`docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_ld-dimension-divisibility.tex`, section
`sec:auxiliary-subline-scalars`.
The restricted component carries mixture weight `1 / (2m)`, so a nonnegative
average bounded by `δ` bounds it by `2mδ`. -/

/-- The evaluated joint line measurement remains consistent with the joint
point measurement on every product of restricted line distributions.

**Conditional auxiliary:** blueprint `thm:conditional-restricted-lines-consistency`.
The supplied `points : CombinedPointsWitness S δQ` and
`lines : CombinedLinesWitness S points δP` include the unrestricted consistency
bound. Applying item 2 of `lem:restricted-line-mixture-bounds` restricts that bound.

or establish the separate source statement `lem:qld-xz-lines-restricted`.
Here `consistencyDefect` is the finite POVM form of the displayed expectation
against `Id - Q` after both measurements are postprocessed by evaluation.
The universal constant is outside all strategy and parameter quantifiers, and
is the exact inflation factor `4` of `avg_restricted_prod_le`. -/

/-! ## The sub-line distribution -/

/-- Existence of the directly indexed sub-line distribution with its two
separate projected point marginals and axis-line closure.  It supports
`lem:qld-sublines` and `rem:qld-sublines-property-three` in
`blueprint/src/chapter/ch15_qpbt_combining.tex`, whose source is
`references/qpbt-paper/14_analysis_of_the_pauli_basis_test.tex:1063-1069` with
its proof at lines 1071--1116.

This is a formalization auxiliary assertion, not the source-labelled
`lem:qld-sublines`.  The extended line uses the directly indexed carrier and
line-point law of `docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_ld-dimension-divisibility.tex` in
place of the seed-indexed line-point distribution over `F_q^(2m+2)` of the
source statement, so the statement carries no divisibility hypothesis and its
transport to the source carrier remains open.  Its `source_mixture` field
asserts only the separate X and Z marginal mixtures, not a stronger joint
conditional law.

The witness is the sub-line law `subLineDist` of the sampling procedure.  Its
pointwise fields follow from `subLineTripleOf_incidence`,
`subLineTripleOf_compatibility`, and `subLineTripleOf_axis_closure`, after
recovering the sampling data with `exists_samplingData_of_mem_subLineDist_support`.
Its extended-line marginal is `subLineDist_map_fst`, and its two projected
point marginals are the separate mixtures of `subLineDist_source_mixture`. -/
