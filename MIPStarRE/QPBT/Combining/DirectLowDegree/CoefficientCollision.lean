# Collision bounds for direct line coefficients

This module bounds the probability that two distinct coefficient vectors give
the same value at a uniformly sampled affine parameter.  It uses the existing
coefficient-polynomial representation and Mathlib's univariate root count.

/-- Two distinct direct coefficient vectors of degree at most `degree` agree
at a uniformly sampled parameter with probability at most `degree / q`.

This is a Lean-only auxiliary. The cited paper passages describe the coefficient
answer format and apply Schwartz-Zippel to a later multivariate collision term;
they do not state this exact univariate averaging bound.

The estimate has no hypothesis `degree < q`; when the displayed bound exceeds
one it remains a valid, deliberately nontruncated root-count bound. -/
