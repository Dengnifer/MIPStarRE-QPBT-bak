# The value of the combined strategy

`lem:ld-combined-value` transports the value of a projective strategy along
`def:ld-combined-strategy`.  Both games weight their nine ordered type pairs
uniformly, so it suffices to bound the rejection probability of each branch of
the combined game by a bounded number of branch rejection probabilities of the
original game.  Splitting a branch according to the event of
`lem:ld-combined-question-law`, the branch conditioned on a point coordinate
index is the branch of the original game at the same ordered type pair, and the
branch conditioned on a combining coordinate index is the point-versus-point
branch of the original game; on each of the two events the relabelling of
`def:ld-combined-strategy` carries acceptance to acceptance, which is
`directCombinedWinTransport_all`.  Each branch of the combined game is therefore
rejected with probability at most the sum of two branch rejection probabilities
of the original game, and summing over the nine branches multiplies the
rejection probability by at most ten.

/-- `lem:ld-combined-value`, rejection form.  Both the directly indexed
low-degree game with the original parameters and the one with the combined

branch-wise bound over the nine pairs bounds the rejection probability of the
combined strategy by the rejection probability of the original strategy plus
its point-versus-point branch; that branch is in turn at most nine times the
