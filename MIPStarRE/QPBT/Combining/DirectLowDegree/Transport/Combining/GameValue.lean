# Index-conditioned rejection probabilities of the directly indexed game

`lem:ld-combined-value` transports the value of a strategy along
`def:ld-combined-strategy` by splitting each branch of the combined game
according to the event of `lem:ld-combined-question-law`, that is according to
whether the stored coordinate index of the common sample is a point coordinate
or a combining coordinate.  This module provides the corresponding refinement
of the branch rejection probability: the uniform average over the common sample
is the uniform average over the stored coordinate index of the average over the
sampled point and the sampled direction alone.

The point-versus-point branch is recorded separately, because it is the branch
that the combining coordinates of the combined game reduce to: both of its
questions are the point question at the sampled point, so its rejected mass
depends on neither the stored coordinate index nor the sampled direction.

All declarations below are formalization-only support derived from the game
value; none is a paper-labelled result.

/-- The Born weight of an answer pair of the combined strategy is the total
Born weight, at the measured questions, of the answer pairs of the original
strategy that the relabelling of `def:ld-combined-strategy` sends to it.  Each
measurement of the combined strategy is a coarse-graining of a measurement of
the original strategy, so its effects are the fiber sums of the original
effects. -/

/-- Rejected-mass comparison for `def:ld-combined-strategy`.  If every answer
pair accepted by the win predicate of the original game at the measured
questions is relabelled to an answer pair accepted by the win predicate of the
combined game, then the rejected mass of the combined strategy at a question
pair of the combined game is at most the rejected mass of the original strategy
at the measured question pair.  This reduces the branch-wise estimates of
`lem:ld-combined-value` to the win-predicate implications of that lemma. -/
