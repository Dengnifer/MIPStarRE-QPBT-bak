# The linear form in the combining variables and its collision estimate

At a fixed point `u` of the original space, the combined polynomial of a tuple
`g` restricts, as a function of the combining variables `α`, to the linear form
`α ↦ ∑_{r < k} g_r(u) α_r`.  The recovery step of the reduction compares two
such linear forms: if the tuple of values `(g_0(u), …, g_{k-1}(u))` differs from
a tuple `b` of answers, then the two linear forms are distinct polynomials of
total degree at most one, so by the Schwartz--Zippel lemma they agree at a
uniformly sampled `α` with probability at most `1/q`.

This module proves that estimate.  It is the quantitative content of the last
paragraph of the source proof, where the same bound is obtained for the
combining map of the surface game.

## Main statements

* `combiningLinearForm_injective` — a linear form determines its coefficients.
* `combiningLinearForm_agreementProbability_le` — the Schwartz--Zippel bound.
* `directCombiningCollision_avg_le` — the bound in the averaged form used by the
  consistency calculus of the directly indexed game.

This is the general form of the computation carried out inline in the proof of
`polynomialAgreement_avg_le_mdq`, which is stated for the point space of the
low individual degree test; the combining variables of the reduction are not a
point space of that test, so the general form is needed here. -/
