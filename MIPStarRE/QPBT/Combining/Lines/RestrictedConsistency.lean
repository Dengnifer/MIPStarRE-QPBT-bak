# Consistency defect under finite conditioning

This module restores an ambient consistency defect from its restriction to a
positive-mass event. The discarded samples contribute at most their total
probability mass.

/-- The ambient consistency defect is at most the retained mass times the
conditional defect, plus the discarded probability mass.

This is a formalization-only generic finite-conditioning estimate supporting
`lem:qld-xz-lines`, paper
`14_analysis_of_the_pauli_basis_test.tex:950-963`. Completeness of the two
measurement families supplies the pointwise unit bound; no separate bound on
the consistency defect is assumed. -/
