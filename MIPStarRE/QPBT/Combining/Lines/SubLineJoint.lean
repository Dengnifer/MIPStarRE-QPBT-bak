# The joint projected law of the concrete sub-line distribution

The two projected line-point pairs of `subLineDist` form a mixture of products
of restricted line-point laws. This is stronger than the two separate marginal
identities in `SubLineWitness`, and is proved for the concrete sampling law.
It gives the consistency estimate used by the second combined-lines argument.

These are directly indexed auxiliary results for blueprint
`lem:qld-subline-joint-mixture`, supporting the second route in
`references/qpbt-paper/14_analysis_of_the_pauli_basis_test.tex:1241-1245`.
The sampling construction is at lines 1071-1116. The source's sub-line statement
does not supply the joint identity. See
`docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_combined-lines-error-term.tex` and issue #510.
The direct carrier and law retain the scope distinction documented in
`docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_ld-dimension-divisibility.tex`.
