# The projected mixtures of the sub-line law

This module assembles the two projected point marginals of the sub-line law of
`lem:qld-sublines` into mixtures of the restricted product laws.  Drawing a
uniform point of the extended line of a mixture of line laws is the same
mixture of the corresponding uniform-point laws, so the two projected
marginals of the sub-line law are the mixtures, over the drawn kind and the
drawn extended coordinate, of the projected marginals of one branch at one
extended coordinate.  Each of those is the component law of the pair of
indices carried by that branch, so the mixing law is the law of the kind
together with the pair of indices assigned to a uniform extended coordinate.

## References

The assembly is the last step of the proof of `lem:qld-sublines` in
blueprint `lem:qld-sublines`, whose source is
`references/qpbt-paper/14_analysis_of_the_pauli_basis_test.tex:1063-1116`.
The restricted laws are `def:ith-restricted-line`, blueprint lines
1209--1228, paper lines 1038--1048.
