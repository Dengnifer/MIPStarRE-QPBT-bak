# Completed point self-consistency

The joint point measurement of `lem:qld-4-10` answers with a pair of field
elements. This module extends both of its answers along the coordinatewise
inclusion into the completed answer alphabet, in which each coordinate may
also be absent, and transports the resulting self-consistency estimate first
to the product of two independent line-point distributions and then to that
product conditioned on a nonzero direction of the first line.

Both orderings of the completed pair are recorded. The pasting argument is
applied to the X-Z-X sandwich, whose inner family is the Z-line family and
whose outer family is the X-line family, so its outcome pair is ordered Z
then X; that ordering, rather than the X-then-Z ordering of the point
measurement itself, is the one that a conditioned marginal comparison in the
same convention would carry.

## Status

These six declarations are auxiliary leaf results in the completed answer
alphabet, recorded for tracking issue 485. Nothing in the repository consumes
them today: main reaches `lem:combined-line-measurement-consistency` by the
point-to-line marginal and pasting route of
`Lines/PointComparison.lean` and `Lines/Conditioning.lean`, which does not
pass through the completed self-consistency estimate. No consumer is claimed
here and none is added by this module.

Their genuine dependencies, all already on main, are
`CombinedPointsWitness.self_consistency_linePoint_defect_le` (the uncompleted
line-point form, `Lines/PointComparison.lean`),
`consistencyDefect_nondegenerateLinePastingDist_le` (the conditioning step,
`Lines/Conditioning.lean`), `consistencyDefect_outcome_equiv`
(`Games/Consistency.lean`) for the coordinate exchange, and
`prod_linePointDist_nondegenerate_mass_pos`
(`Lines/NondegeneratePastingDistribution.lean`) for the retained mass.

## References

The point estimate is `eq:qld-q-self-cons` in
`references/qpbt-paper/14_analysis_of_the_pauli_basis_test.tex:693-697`; it
enters the pasting argument as `eq:pasting-2` at lines 950--963. The
statements below are formalization-only consequences of that estimate: they
carry the completed answer alphabet, the product line-point question law
rather than the uniform law on point pairs, and, in the conditioned form, the
restricted question law with the error inflated by the inverse retained mass.
None of them completes a gap in the source; each is a strictly weaker
transported form of an estimate the paper already states.
Their blueprint entries are `lem:qld-completed-point-answers`,
`lem:qld-completed-point-self-consistency`, and
`lem:qld-conditioned-completed-point-self-consistency`.
