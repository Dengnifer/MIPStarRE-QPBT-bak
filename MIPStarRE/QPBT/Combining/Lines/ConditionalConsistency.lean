# Consistency defects under finite conditioning

This module bounds the consistency defect of two complete measurements after
the question distribution is conditioned on a positive-mass event.  For
measurements placed on opposite expanded registers, the pointwise defect is
nonnegative, so conditioning inflates the average by at most the inverse
retained mass.

/-- Conditioning the question distribution of two complete measurements on a
positive-mass event inflates their consistency defect by at most the inverse
retained mass.  This is a formalization-only auxiliary for the conditioned
line comparisons in paper

Pointwise nonnegativity is derived from positivity of POVM effects placed on
opposite expanded registers; it is not an additional hypothesis. -/
