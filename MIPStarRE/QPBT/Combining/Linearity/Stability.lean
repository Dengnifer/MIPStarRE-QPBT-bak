# Boolean representation stability

This file completes the proof of the quantum linearity theorem of Natarajan
and Vidick in its multiplicative-defect formulation.  A family of
binary observables `O^u`, indexed by the Boolean cube `F_2^t` and weighted by a
positive semidefinite trace-one operator `ρ`, whose products `O^u O^v` are on
average close to `O^{u+v}` in the state-dependent distance, is on average close,
in the same distance and weighted by the extended state `ρ ⊗ |anc⟩⟨anc|`, to
an exactly linear family of binary observables on an ancillary extension.

The extension, the ancillary vector, and the exactly linear family are those
of the Naimark rounding of the Fourier-square POVM.  The main computation is
an identity, not an inequality: the average squared state-dependent operator
distance between the rounded family and the ampliated original family,
weighted by `ρ ⊗ |anc⟩⟨anc|`, equals the average multiplicative defect of the
original family weighted by `ρ`.  Both sides equal
`2 - 2 * (two-query correlation)`.  The left side reduces to the
correlation by compressing the rounded observables along the ancillary vector
and applying the cubic Fourier identity; the right side is the operator BLR
computation, including the reindexing of the uniform pair.  No commutation
among the observables is assumed, and the weight `ρ` is never replaced by the
normalized trace.

## Main results

* `heteroKron_ancProj_posSemidef` and `trace_heteroKron_ancProj`: the extended
  weight `ρ ⊗ |anc⟩⟨anc|` is again positive semidefinite with trace one.
* `re_trace_roundedObservable_mul_heteroKron`: the compression of the
  correlation between a rounded observable and the ampliated original
  observable to the original space.
* `stateDepDistSq_roundedObservable`: the pointwise distance between a rounded
  observable and the ampliated original observable, in terms of the overlap
  with the character sum of the Fourier-square POVM.
* `avg_stateDepDistSq_roundedObservable_eq_avg_multiplicativeDefect`: the
  distance/defect identity
  `E_u d_{ρ'}(L^u, O^u ⊗ 1)^2 = E_{u,v} d_ρ(O^u O^v, O^{u+v})^2`.
* `exists_exact_boolean_representation`: the Boolean representation stability
  theorem, obtained by weakening the identity to the incoming bound.

/-! ## The distance/defect identity -/

/-- The correlation between a rounded observable `L^u` and the ampliated
original observable `O^u ⊗ 1`, evaluated in the extended state
`ρ ⊗ |anc⟩⟨anc|`, has the same real part as the overlap between `O^u` and the
character sum `∑_v (-1)^{v·u} B^v` of the Fourier-square POVM evaluated in
`ρ`.  Taking the adjoint of the triple product reverses the order of the three
Hermitian factors, after which the ampliated observable is absorbed into the
weight and the rounded observable is compressed along the ancillary vector.
This is the passage from `Tr_{ρ'}(A(a) 𝒜(a))` to
`Tr_ρ(A(a) ∑_u (-1)^{u·a} (hat A^u)^2)` at
`references/nv-paper/fullpaper.tex:1105-1110`, with the operator order in the
state-dependent distance preserved. -/

/-! ## Boolean representation stability -/

/-- Boolean representation stability.  Let `t` be positive, `η ≥ 0`, `ρ` a
positive semidefinite trace-one operator on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space,
and `O^u`, for `u ∈ F_2^t`, binary observables whose products satisfy
`E_{u,v} d_ρ(O^u O^v, O^{u+v})^2 ≤ η`.  Then there are a finite-dimensional
ancillary Hilbert space, a unit vector `anc` in it, and binary observables `L^u`
on the tensor-product Hilbert space with `L^u L^v = L^{u+v}` for all `u, v` and
`E_u d_{ρ'}(L^u, O^u ⊗ 1)^2 ≤ η`, where `ρ' = ρ ⊗ |anc⟩⟨anc|`.

The ancillary Hilbert space used in the proof is
`EuclideanSpace ℂ (Option (Fin t → ZMod 2))`.  The finite type
`Option (Fin t → ZMod 2)` indexes an orthonormal basis, with one basis vector
for each element of `F_2^t` and one extra basis vector; it is not itself the
Hilbert space.  The vector is the canonical ancillary vector of the Naimark
dilation, and the family is the rounded observables of the Fourier-square POVM;
the bound is the distance/defect identity
`avg_stateDepDistSq_roundedObservable_eq_avg_multiplicativeDefect` weakened by
the hypothesis.

**Local fix:** This is the mathematical content of Theorem 10 of
Natarajan--Vidick, `references/nv-paper/fullpaper.tex:1074-1088`, quoted at
`references/qpbt-paper/14_analysis_of_the_pauli_basis_test.tex:711-725` and
stated as blueprint
`thm:linearity`, but not that displayed
statement: the hypothesis here is the average multiplicative defect rather
than the two-query correlation.  By
`avg_multiplicativeDefect_le_two_mul_error`, a correlation at least `1 - δ`
gives the present hypothesis with `η = 2δ`, so the conclusion obtained from a
correlation hypothesis is the bound `2δ` for the average squared
state-dependent operator distance.  The provider theorem displays `δ` for
that distance, while `thm:linearity` records the corrected `2δ` bound.  That
factor of two is the normalization refuted in
`docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_linearity-distance-normalization.tex`; the blueprint
entry for the present statement is `lem:boolean-representation-stability`.
The positivity of `t` and the nonnegativity of `η` are part of the quoted
statement and are not needed by the proof. -/
