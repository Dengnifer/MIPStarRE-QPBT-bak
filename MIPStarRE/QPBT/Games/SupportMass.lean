/-! # Marginal mass outside the support of a reference measurement

A complete reference measurement supported on an allowed outcome set bounds
the other measurement's mass outside that set by their bipartite consistency
defect. The measurements act on separate tensor factors of the same state.
Neither projectivity nor state normalization is needed; for a unit vector the
quadratic forms are the corresponding Born probabilities.

These are formalization-only auxiliary estimates for the non-encoding mass
calculation in blueprint `eq:qld-nonencoding-mass`. They can be composed with
the codeword-defect comparison after constructing an encoding-supported
reference measurement on the opposite tensor factor. They do not construct
that reference or establish its evaluated consistency, and do not prove the
non-encoding marginal-mass bound or global-pair witness existence.

/-- The mass of a measurement outside the support of a complete reference
measurement is at most their off-diagonal tensor overlap. Completeness of the
reference expands each marginal mass into a row of joint probabilities;
support makes the diagonal term zero, and positivity bounds the restricted
sum by the full defect. This is a formalization-only auxiliary for blueprint
`eq:qld-nonencoding-mass`, valid for arbitrary state vectors. -/

/-- Averaging the supported-reference mass bound gives the same inequality
for the bipartite consistency defect with the existing left and right tensor
placements.
This formalization-only auxiliary for blueprint `eq:qld-nonencoding-mass`
requires neither a probability distribution nor a normalized state, so it
applies in particular to the normalized state used in that calculation. -/
