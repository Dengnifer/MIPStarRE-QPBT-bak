# The approximate form of the symmetrization lemma

The source proof of blueprint `lem:symmetric-strat`, paper
`references/qpbt-paper/06_nonlocal_games_and_mipstar.tex:101-132`, chooses for
every `ε' > ε` a strategy of value at least `1 - ε'` from the supremum
defining `Game.value` and symmetrizes it.  This file formalizes exactly that
passage, on top of the value-preserving construction
`exists_symmetric_projective_strategy_of_strategy` proved in
`MIPStarRE.QPBT.Games.StrategyClasses`.

## Main results

* `exists_symmetric_projective_strategy_approx` — blueprint
  `lem:symmetric-strat`, the corrected statement of that node: the approximate
  form in the source's own shape.
* `exists_symmetric_projective_strategy_of_lt_value` — the same statement in
  slack form.

The exact-attainment assertion printed as `lem:symmetric-strat` is **not**
proved here or anywhere in this development, and is asserted nowhere. It is
recorded verbatim, unasserted, as the proposition
`PrintedSymmetricProjectiveAttainmentClaim` in
`MIPStarRE.QPBT.Games.StrategyClasses`, where its universally quantified form
is also refuted on the current Lean domain by
`not_forall_printedSymmetricProjectiveAttainmentClaim`. The analysis is in
`docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_symmetrization-attainment.tex` and issue `#524`.

/-- A game with nonempty answer alphabets has at least one strategy: the
one-dimensional strategy that answers deterministically.  This is the
boundary condition separating the source domain, where the answer alphabet is
a nonempty finite set, from the Lean domain, where `Game.AnswerA` may be
empty and the supremum defining `Game.value` is then the totalized supremum of
the empty set.  See `docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_symmetrization-attainment.tex`. -/

/-- Approximate symmetrization in slack form, blueprint
`lem:symmetric-strat` in its corrected statement, paper
`references/qpbt-paper/06_nonlocal_games_and_mipstar.tex:101-132`: for every
positive slack `δ` a symmetric projective strategy comes within `δ` of the
game value.  The proof is the source argument verbatim -- choose a strategy
above the strict lower bound `Game.value - δ`, then apply the value-preserving
construction `exists_symmetric_projective_strategy_of_strategy`.

The hypothesis `Nonempty G.Answer` is the source's standing assumption that
the answer alphabet is a nonempty finite set; it is load-bearing in the Lean
domain, where an empty answer alphabet admits no strategy at all while
`Game.value` is still defined, so the conclusion is then false.  No attainment
claim is made at `δ = 0`: the printed attainment form is recorded unasserted as
`PrintedSymmetricProjectiveAttainmentClaim` and analyzed in
`docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_symmetrization-attainment.tex`. -/

/-- Approximate symmetrization in the source's own shape, blueprint
`lem:symmetric-strat` in its corrected statement, paper
`references/qpbt-paper/06_nonlocal_games_and_mipstar.tex:94-132`: if
`val*(G) = 1 - ε` then for every `ε' > ε` there is a symmetric projective
strategy of value at least `1 - ε'`.  This is what the source proof of
`lem:symmetric-strat` establishes, and it is the official formalization of
that node.  The printed conclusion at `ε' = ε` additionally asserts that the
supremum defining `Game.value` is attained; it is asserted nowhere here and is
recorded unasserted as `PrintedSymmetricProjectiveAttainmentClaim`, analyzed in
`docs/paper-gaps/qpbt_symmetrization-attainment.tex`.

As in `exists_symmetric_projective_strategy_of_lt_value`, `Nonempty G.Answer`
is the source's nonempty answer alphabet, made explicit because the Lean
domain admits an empty one. -/
